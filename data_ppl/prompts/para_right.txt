Your task is to determine whether the model answer is consistent with the standard answer in terms of content and conclusion, i.e., their answer consistency.

Note that the input and output formats are as follows:  
Input format:  
【Standard Answer】  
[TEXT_START]  
XXXX (content of the standard answer)  
[TEXT_END]  
【Model Answer】  
[TEXT_START]  
XXXX (content of the model answer)  
[TEXT_END]  

Output format:  
【Judgment Result】  
[SAME_ANSWER]  
X (whether the answers are consistent; X=true if the model answer and standard answer are consistent in content and conclusion, otherwise X=false)  
[SAME_ANSWER]  
[REASON_START]  
XXXX (reason for consistency or inconsistency)  
[REASON_END]  

Once you understand the background and input/output formats above, you need to determine whether the model answer and standard answer are consistent in content and conclusion according to the following rules:  
1. If the model answer and standard answer differ in the final answer or conclusion, then the answers are inconsistent.  
2. If the key points in the model answer (key points refer to the semantic content described in the text, i.e., the described objects, explanations, conclusions, etc.) are fewer or more than those in the standard answer, then the answers should also be judged as inconsistent.  
3. The wording of the model answer and standard answer may differ, i.e., there can be some variation in content, but the key points mentioned in Rule 2 must be reflected (the comparison is based on semantics, not verbatim).  
4. Note that line breaks and whitespace characters in the model answer do not affect the judgment of answer consistency.  
5. If the model answer and standard answer are in different languages, then the answers are inconsistent.  

Below are some input-output examples for reference:

Regarding the question about genital herpes, based on the known information, I cannot provide a relevant answer. The reasons are as follows:  

1. The known information focuses on legally notifiable diseases in the fever-with-rash syndrome, including measles, rubella, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, chickenpox, shingles, etc., but does not mention genital herpes.  
2. Genital herpes falls under the category of sexually transmitted diseases (mainly caused by HSV-2), which is different from the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and enterovirus (EV) covered in the current materials.  
3. The vaccination plans in the existing materials (e.g., recombinant zoster vaccine) only target the varicella-zoster virus and do not involve prevention for genital herpes.  

It is recommended to consult a professional medical institution or a dermatologist/venereologist for targeted diagnosis and treatment advice. For international logistics-related infectious disease prevention measures, we can provide professional advice, but this question is beyond our expertise.
