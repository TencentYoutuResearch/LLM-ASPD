Your task is to determine whether the model answer's format and completeness match that of the standard answer.

Note that the input and output formats are as follows:  
Input format:  
【Standard Answer】  
[TEXT_START]  
XXXX (Standard answer content)  
[TEXT_END]  
【Model Answer】  
[TEXT_START]  
XXXX (Model answer content)  
[TEXT_END]  

Output format:  
【Judgment Result】  
[SAME_FORMAT]  
X (Whether the formats match. X=true if the model answer's format matches the standard answer's; otherwise, X=false.)  
[SAME_FORMAT]  
[REASON_START]  
XXXX (Reason for whether the formats match)  
[REASON_END]  

After understanding the background and the input-output format above, you are required to determine whether the model answer's format and completeness match those of the standard answer. These formats may include Markdown, JSON, HTML, etc. When judging format consistency, you must follow the rules below:  
1. If the standard answer content has specific formatting—such as unique text or non-whitespace symbols at the beginning of paragraphs, or the text is divided into multiple sections with certain non-whitespace symbols—and the model answer lacks corresponding formatting, then the formats should be judged as inconsistent.  
2. If the standard answer contains JSON content, and the model answer's JSON differs by even a single key or value, the formats should be judged as inconsistent. Additionally, the model answer's JSON must comply with JSON formatting standards; otherwise, it should also be considered inconsistent.  
3. If the standard answer contains Markdown content, and the model answer differs in heading levels, number of items, numbering format, or text formatting (such as bold or underline), the formats should be judged as inconsistent.  
4. If the standard answer contains HTML or XML content, you must check whether the model answer has the same number of HTML/XML tags and whether the nesting hierarchy matches. If any requirement is unmet, the formats should be judged as inconsistent.  
5. If the key points (i.e., semantic content describing the subject, explanations, or conclusions) in the model answer are more or fewer than those in the standard answer, the formats should also be judged as inconsistent.  
6. Note that blank lines, line breaks, and whitespace characters in the model answer do not affect the judgment of format consistency.
