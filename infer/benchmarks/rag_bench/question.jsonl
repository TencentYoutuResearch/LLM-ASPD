Hear him: ‘it is regrettable that African countries spend between $30 billion and $50billion annually on imports of agricultural products, instead of developing the productive capacities necessary for trade’.\nAccording to the United Nations’ 2015 World Population Prospect Report, 2.4 billion people are projected to be added to the global population between 2015 and 2050, with 1.3 billion in Africa alone. Which means by 2050, Africa will house more than half of the world’s population and as at now no preparation is being made on how it will feed its 1.3 billion population by 2050. What about the now? 2050 is still some years ahead; what are the African leaders doing to stop, or at least, reduce the importation of finished agricultural products. Currently, Africa is still unable to feed itself and depends on importation of products to feed its people. What will happen by 2050, if a stop is not put to this trend?\nThe potential for growth in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa is well understood, but has not been realised. Currently, the agro-allied industry (in primary processing) accounts for nearly half of all economic the activity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the continent spends $30bn to $50bn each year importing food and still has significant food risk and nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the region. This is despite the fact that the continent holds much of the world’s potential agricultural land (Africa has 65% of the world arable land).\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO), Africa spends $35 billion in importing food, and it is projected that the number will grow to $110 billion by 2025. Africa is importing what it should be producing, creating poverty within the region and consequently creating jobs for the people in other continents while its people lack opportunities.\nIt is interesting to note that African countries import numerous agricultural products which are also, ironically, produced locally. The rise of imports for these Agricultural products has been attributed to the inability to produce enough to satisfy growing local demand, due to low yields and relatively low levels of productivity. Furthermore, over 80% of Africa’s agricultural products are being produced by smallholder farmers who produce 70% of the continent’s food supply, according to FAO.\nTaking a look at Agricultural exports, one discovers that African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea and vegetables to the rest of the world. The main agricultural importing countries of the African export are the United States, China, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nAfrican countries do not feature under the top supplying countries for any of these markets. If Africa is serious about changing from agricultural product importers, then addressing the following issues are of paramount importance: innovation in production technology, the cost of inputs (energy and fertilisers), management of changes in climatic conditions (e.g. access to water through irrigation), knowledge transfer and capacity building, investment in agriculture and agriculture-related infrastructure (credit facilities, transportation networks, cold-storage facilities and communication networks) and access to information.\nALSO READ: Questions on Nigeria’s 2017 Budget\nGovernments and leaders in Africa (past and present) should (have) know(n) in importing food is a serious minus for the leadership of the component countries in Africa.\nAgriculture is also a major component for Africa becoming an industrialised continent, in the sense that its raw materials are needed in production of other commodities. Africa has come of age and its agricultural practices should be driven by research, mechanisation and modern technology to steer it away from remaining rudimentary.\nBecoming. All those foreign long sleeved shirts, locally made agbadas and tunics need to be rolled up for work; the continent cannot remain hungry when there are seeds, lands and technology around.\nAPRECON\nquestion:What are the main agricultural products that African countries export to the rest of the world?"]}

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people’s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people’s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people’s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people’s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.\nAt least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.\nImportant Dates\nSubmission Deadline: January 14, 2011\nNotification of acceptance: February 11, 2011\nWorkshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS\nUta Hinrichs is a PhD candidate in computational media design at the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group of the University of Calgary, Canada, under the supervision of Sheelagh Carpendale.

If you need that loan, your options become a great deal narrower if you donвЂ™t have a bank account. You canвЂ™t write a check without one, nor is it possible to head to an ATM. Plus, many loan providers which can be payday nonetheless need you’ve got really a vendor account before theyвЂ™ll lend for you personally. an advance loan might be an alternative solution, but could you will get one with no banking account? The answer allow me expose вЂ¦ perhaps. To begin with, this can rely in what you recommend by вЂњcash advance. вЂќ\nAn advance loan is a mode of charge card deal. Instead of use that is making of card to simply make a purchase, you should utilize a money loan in your card to obtain paper money. The amount that you withdraw is likely to be placed into your total security, the way that is exact exact same the cost of a transaction that is ordinary.\nBesides the money you receive, pay day loans change from normal credit card deals in three important means. First, numerous cards charge a extra expense for taking out an advance loan. Typically this expense is something like вЂњ$5 or 3percent for the volume withdrawn, whichever is greater. вЂќ consequently straight away, you ought to invest to get cash insurance firms an advance loan.\n2nd, payday advances tend not to add a pursuit elegance duration that is free.\nWith traditional purchases, there is typically an one month display between when the purchase is established when the purchase volume starts accruing interest. Meaning that when you’re able to spend that stability down in complete prior to the elegance duration finishes, it is possible to avoid spending any additional costs.\nNonetheless with pay day loans, that interest begins accruing right away. Between that interest along with the loan price, thereвЂ™s simply no real option to prevent extra cash this is certainly additional. Plus, the eye costs for pay day loans are really a complete great deal more than the interest charges for regular discounts. If youвЂ™d like to just you need to a cash loan call at your charge card, it will run you. (fed up with relying on payday advances for crisis costs? Check always away our blog post: Saving ways of Avoid a High Interest payday loan. )\nCan you obtain a credit card without a bank account?\nThe thing that makes we asking this concern? Well, its because it also includes the middle of why giving an answer to this relevant concern could be therefore tricky. See, while charge cards advance loan doesn’t have a bank account, youвЂ™re probably like to a banking account to have that bank card inside the accepted spot that is first. Theoretically, the clear response is yes. In truth? ItвЂ™s a no.\nYou donвЂ™t have a bank account, youвЂ™re going to be away from fortune if youвЂ™re trying to find a normal unsecured charge card. Almost all charge cards will likely require that you have a bank account before theyвЂ™ll approve you. Devoid of a banking account is a massive red advertising for them it indicates youвЂ™re greatly predisposed to not ever repay everything you borrow. If you canвЂ™t just take a charge card away with out a checking account, and that means you wonвЂ™t allow you to geting an advance loan without one either.\nYou’re getting an advance loan with a secured credit card or debit card that is prepaid.\nPeople who donвЂ™t have bank documents can however make application for a secured credit card. Together with your cards, a money is created for you personally by you deposit into a merchant account that the card issuer opens up. That cash volume then determines your borrowing restriction. So a $500 deposit shall suggest a $500 limitation. You could then use this secured credit card just to just take straight down a loan.\nBut this arrangement raises problem: Why is it possible to make usage of secured charge card to merely you need to take a cash loan out when you could merely utilize the cash that you already deposited to start within the card? Well, the possibilities are excellent which you most likely have credit that is bad youвЂ™re in this example. Having a credit this is certainly guaranteed and making your instalments on time is a superb choice to raise your credit score up such a long time considering that the card company reports into the credit scoring agencies.\nWhile secured charge cards normally have greater fees ( perhaps not mention more costs) than mainstream bank cards, using some of those is a lot better than exactly what is doing cash. Using one properly can raise your credit rating after a while, ultimately leading that you a card with much better advantages and paid down prices.\nYou could subscribe to a prepaid debit card to just just take straight down a advance loan. The funds are packed straight on your card; the amount of money is yours to spend, without any interest accruing after all with your items. You possibly can make utilization of one of these brilliant cards at an ATM to obtain cash but itвЂ™ll probably include far more charges as compared to typical standard advance loan would. Plus, unlike guaranteed in full credit cards, a prepaid debit card wonвЂ™t enhance your credit. (to see more about additional options to traditional banking, check our article down: just how to endure in a Banking Desert. )\nSome вЂњcash advanceвЂќ loans donвЂ™t need a bank account.\nKeep in mind at the beginning of the time on this page if we talked about payday loan? Those are short-term, high interest no credit check loans that are created to easy and quick however in trade, they are a great deal more high priced than a day to day unsecured loan, and theyвЂ™re aimed at those that have really poor credit ranks. The typical term for a payday loan is something like a few weeks, having a annual part price (APR) of 350per cent.\nHereвЂ™s the benefit that is plain of time loans: many of them promote by themselves as вЂњcash advanceвЂќ loans. Despite the fact that numerous payday improvements do require you to have checking account, there are many that donвЂ™t. Numerous bad credit loans will direct deposit your funds in to the bank bank checking account, but pay day loans that donвЂ™t require a banking account will either control you cash or will position the money on a debit card that is prepaid.\nquestion:Can you get a cash advance without a bank account?"]}

Having sold 10.8 million copies, it's the 14th-best-selling album in the history of SoundScan. But sales figures aside, it was Em stepping into the prime of his career. It was a lightning rod for controversy in the year 2000 when CD sales hit their all time peak. At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it—culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John. But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist.\nIn many ways, MMLP picked up where his previous album, The Slim Shady LP, left off—many of the new songs mirrorred older ones. There's another \"Public Service Announcement\" (once again voiced by Jeff Bass of The Bass Brothers), Em calls \"Drug Ballad\" his \"love song\" the way he called \"Cum On Everybody\" his \"dance song,\" and the \"holy-shit-this-guy-is-out-of-his-fucking-mind-but-also-amazing\" song \"Kim\" is a prequel to \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde.\"\nThe brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em's anger is the hallmark of this album. This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music.\nUnlike his debut, however, the album got past being seen as silly or cheesy. In 1999, we didn't know what to make of this angry blonde dude because it was hard to tell when the jokes started and ended. In 2000, things became clearer as he delved further into autobiographical territory. We started to hear the seriousness in the stories about how he used to get \"beat up, peed on, be on free lunch, and changed school every three months.\"\nThe album sounded different too. While Dr. Dre provided only three beats The Slim Shady LP, here, he and his partner Mel-Man handled most of the first half of the album, with Eminem and The Bass Brothers taking over for most of the second. Even when it came to the production credits, duality remained a running theme for Eminem (or is that Slim Shady?)\nThe brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em's anger is the hallmark of this album. This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music. Em's words are so precise and he's so in control of his pen, yet he's so emotionally erratic. (Maybe a lasting effect of his infamous Amsterdam acid trip, upon which he claims he wrote so much of the album that he considered calling it Amsterdam.)\nHe rages against everyone; past tormentors, magazines that made fun of him (\"Double-XL, Double-XL!\"), his mother, his wife, and even manages to aim an AK at Dre's face, just because. But he's so damn good at it you hardly want to hear anyone else rapping. There isn't a long guest list, but every voice other than Em's feels like a distraction you want to fast-forward past. How could we listen to anyone else when Em was spontaneously combusting before our very ears? The rage was magnetic, hypnotic. \"Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts!\"!!\"\nThe anger spews in every direction as he takes reckless shots at pop culture's other famous figures. Maybe because Em was still a battle rapper at heart, one in need of a bullseye to aim his verbal darts at. He spends a lot of time lashing out at his critics, too.!!\" Lines from \"Criminal\" like \"Hate fags? The answer's yes\" are way too literal for a rapper so obsessed with weaving such an intricate web of humor and horror. And there are always lines he won't cross. One verse later he rhymes \"I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker/Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word...\" He stops there. There's still one word out there that even Eminem won't say.\nDespite the album's artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it's hard to call it an \"influential\" album. Sure, there are lots of white rappers today and Em certainly inspired part of that, but all of them shy away from Em comparisons. And none of them—stylistically, musically, and definitely lyrically—can hold a candle to Eminem at his peak. Really, no one of any race can compare.\nBar for bar, line for line, Eminem is and always will be a rapper's rapper. But this isn't the typical \"rap\" album, it's so far removed from hip-hop's sonic center and typical subject matter. It's an Eminem album, and this is when Eminem became EMINEM. And Eminem isn't your regular rapper, not your regular pop star. He's what he's shown to be on the back cover of the album, a freak genius who likes to write raps. There he sits, Marshall, and he sits alone. —Insanul Ahmed\nquestion:Who were the producers of Eminem's album, The Marshall Mathers LP?"]}
{"question_id": 9, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nMost of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life’s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock’s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don’t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you’re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic.

As a result many of the motels in the Wildwoods were built with themes that were popular in that era and would have attracted young families. It was the age of the automobile, the sputnik and the space race, of Hawaiian / Polynesian fascination, and many other post World War themes. The motels of that era reflected those aspirational times and themes in their architecture and decorative theming.\nThe Wildwoods of today have embraced those themed architectural styles and have labeled them collectively 'doo wop' architecture. Throughout the town are many examples of that style. Many buildings being designed and built today in the Wildwoods also reflect doo wop style.

Where the Wimmenz Are.\nA survey of Catholics in Germany and Switzerland shows that most reject the church's teachings on contraception, divorce, sexual morality and gay unions. This will not change the moral teachings of the church.\nWell, of course not, and not only because the results might be different elsewhere in the world.\nAnd despite some statements by pope Francis, neither is much going to change in the official teachings of the church about the proper place of women*, though it could well be the case that your average Catholic in this country or in Germany or Switzerland might not agree with those teachings, either.\nI have written before about the three pillars on which the general second-class status of women depend** (religion, laws and science/pseudoscience). Out of the three it is religion which is the hardest and the slowest to change, because the holy books, written when cultures were very patriarchal, can always be interpreted as the written law of god. Once someone does that, well, you are arguing with a divine power.\nThis doesn't mean that religions cannot change or that there aren't religions which have changed. Some do wonderful work on women and gender. But there's a lot of work still to be done within the three large Abrahamic religions***.\n-------\n*The teachings about contraception, sexual morality, divorce and gay unions are also linked to the proper place of women, of course.\n**I use the pillars metaphor on purpose, because the old argument often consist of both restricting women's roles in the society and of putting them on a partial pedestal, especially as mothers. You can't leap off the pedestal without getting hurt but on the other hand your specific female talents (which the current pope attributes to women) can be more easily worshiped that way.\n***And probably in other religions, too..\nquestion:What are the three pillars on which the general second-class status of women depend according to Echidne of the Snakes?"]}

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company's technology and prevent others from infringing it;\nquestion:What is the purpose of the U.S. patent 9,879,053 issued to Argos Therapeutics Inc.?"]}

While the measure itself narrows down the amount of qualifying diagnoses or conditions that would qualify a patient for the therapeutic use of cannabis within the state, New York’s program was drafted with careful and strict controls that will operate under very tight regulation and oversight.\nPatients who are certified by a licensed healthcare practitioner to use medical marijuana in New York are required to register with the New York State Department of Health and must obtain a New York medical marijuana card, which will serve as a means of identification for the state-sanctioned patient registry.\nThe passage of this bill makes New York the 23rd state in the country, to set the foundation for a medical marijuana program. “The Compassionate Care Act” outlines a limited list of different debilitating medical conditions, for which marijuana is recommended to be medically beneficial. Before the bill’s passage, state lawmakers narrowed down the list of qualifying conditions that would allow a patient to qualify for the program.

{"question_id": 21, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nNon-Functional Requirements in an Agile World\nAs an Agile enthusiast I’ve always rejected ‘Requirements’ as being old-school and contrary to the Agile way. However I’ve just come across Roxanne Millar’s book ‘The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus’.\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\n- SAFe [SAFe].\nSAFe describes NFRs as “persistent qualities and constraints”.\nMany NFRs begin their lives as ‘Enablers’ that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 – Responding to Cohn’s post] proposes an alternative format:\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of ‘Supplementary Requirements’ listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the ‘SAFe Requirements model’ presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb’s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don’t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example – see [SAFe].\nGilb says:\n“…it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts”. “Quality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable”.\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued – See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb’s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler’s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\nConclusion\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\nReferences:\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing – Gabrielle Benefield\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\n- [Gilb] What’s Wrong With Agile Methods –Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification – Gilb & Brodie 2007\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract\nquestion:What does SAFe describe Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) as?"]}

Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service\nquestion:What are some of the services provided by the Asha Project?"]}
{"question_id": 25, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nI received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\n- How to make a backup?\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\nThe books is available online here.\nProfile\nquestion:What are the two main sections of the book about mobile security published by Packt?"]}

Thanks to the Museum regarding the City of brand new York.\nHistory\nInitially exposed as being a restaurant c. 1950, the ocean Colony had become a hangout that is lesbian at minimum 1955, whenever Ann Bannon, composer of lesbian pulp fiction, visited it with Marijane Meaker, writer of lesbian-themed fiction. Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned “a recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. ” The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar’s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a “butch-femme” powerful, where in actuality the “butch, ” or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the “man’s” role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex – purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. – and also the “femme, ” or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the “woman’s” role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the “butches” usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the “femmes” sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with “opposite intercourse” had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the “three article” rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women’s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact “Country Club. ”\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar’s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs. One former regular said of her experience during the water Colony (her punctuation), “my first bar within the town was at the sixties in the SEA COLONY…………. Its as you come in a film as your head starts a lens into the last……. Everyone sluggish danced on to the floor. Lights were dim…. And Maria had been the bar maid/butch…who everybody wanted…. She had been ALL OF THAT. …. ”\nThis entry had been compiled by task consultant Gwendolyn Stegall.\nquestion:What was the Sea Colony and who was its primary clientele during the 1950s and 1960s?"]}

Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)\n- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax\n- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.\nI was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.\nI was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.\nIf you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it.

This doesn't and it heals my hands. Forget wondering if it will work. I am telling you right now it does and is well worth the cost. (Posted on 2/16/13)\n- Fantastic.

(Posted on 2/4/13)\n- best ever Review by deean\n- i just love this hand cream its not greasy at all and soaks right in my hands please bring it back (Posted on 1/22/13)\n- GREAT Review by butterfly6801\n- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)\n- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam\n- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\nSo really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.\nquestion:What is the main objective of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project led by the team of Michigan University professors?"]}

The purpose of this computer is mainly gaming, 3D modeling, a ton of college work, and to be overkill... The college work consist of \"normal\" engineering homework to more advance simulations and of course the aforementioned 3D modeling. At the time of building this computer, it cost roughly $2600. A full price breakdown, along with a total, can be found in the images above. I am sure if anyone is looking at this in the near future, most of the prices will be nonexistent on the part list due to parts being replaced by their predecessors.\nI have not settled on an overclock for my CPU yet, but I have mess around with it quite a bit. I do not think I will be leaving my CPU on a permanent overclock due to the heat it generates. In my previous build I had a FX-8370 CPU paired with a Gigabyte - Radeon R9 390X 8 GB SOC GPU (The Atomic Pillar) and that combo would literally raise my bedroom temperature 10°F to 15°F, and I do not want to go back to that. If I do settle on a permanent overclock, my goal will be to have the CPU's clock rate between 4.15 GHz and 4.20 GHz. The maximum temperature I hit on my CPU under stock-clock is 58°C with an ambient room temperature of 24°C, so there is a decent amount of headroom when it comes to temperatures, since the maximum temperature for the Ryzen 7 - 2700X is around 85°C. This maximum temperature of 58°C was reached after nine straight hours of running an AIDA64 Extreme CPU stress test. This stresses the CPU at 100% until the test is manually stopped or the CPU thermal throttles.\nThe maximum temperature reached by the EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11 GB SC2 was also achieved after running an AIDA64 stress test, but this stress test was only ran for one hour. The GPU stress test on AIDA64 works in the same manner as the CPU stress test. It utilizes 100% of the GPU for the duration of the stress test, or until the GPU thermal throttles.

{"question_id": 32, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nHigh Priest’s Garments - The Anointing and Significance of Blue\nContinuing with the series on High Priest, here is an excerpt from my sermon notes. (Skipping last week’s sermon on linen.) I did my best to summarize it, but this sermon is really oozing with revelations. Be blessed!\nFirst off, the robe of the ephod (Exo 28:31-35). Note that the opening for the head was reinforced so that it cannot be torn. The High Priest cannot tear clothes by the law. (Lev 21:10) However, Caiaphas, the High Priest at the time of Jesus’ crucifixion, tore his clothes. (Mat 26:65, Mar 14:63) He broke the law. Without knowing it, what he did signified the change of order of priesthood.\nJesus is our High Priest, after the order of Melchizedek. The only difference between Jesus and the Israel High Priests is the order of priesthood. In Aaronic priesthood, the priests blessed only on the condition of obedience, and cursed if there was disobedience, in accordance with the law. (Lev 26:3-29) In Melchizedek priesthood, however, as seen in the book of Genesis, Melchizedek always blessed. He blessed Abraham (then Abram) and the Father, and gave Abraham bread and wine. In fact, the first word that came out of his mouth was “blessed”. (Gen 14:19) So Jesus, our High Priest in the order or Melchizedek, always speaks and does blessings.\nRemember that the law demands righteousness, while grace gives righteousness. Under grace, even when you fail, you still receive blessings, and this will make you want to do right.\nNext, we look at the anointing of the priesthood in Exodus 29:4-10. In verse 7, there was the anointing of Aaron as High Priest. Then, from verse 10, animals were brought and slaughtered; it was not until verse 21, after the animals were slaughtered, that Aaron’s sons were anointed.\nAs Aaron was the High Priest and his sons were priests, today, as we are a royal priesthood with Jesus as our High Priest, Aaron’s sons was a type of us. This is a beautiful picture of what happened. Jesus Christ was anointed before He died. We were anointed after His death, which was signified by the animals’ sacrifice.\nOne more thing about the High Priest’s anointing is the divine order found in this ordination. When the High Priest is anointed, oil flows from the High Priest’s head down his beard before it reaches his body. This is depicted in a psalm, Psalm 133:1-3.\nThe order his head, beard, body (all the way to the edge). So this is God’s order: blessing goes from the head, which is the pastors, then to the elders, signified by the beard, then to the body, that is the entire church. Due to this order, when you pray for your pastors, you are, in fact, praying for yourself, because as the leader goes, so goes the church. Do not be jealous when the pastors get blessed; know that you are next in line! Hallelujah!\nBack to Exodus 28:31, the robe of the ephod is blue in colour.\nNow blue, as we learned, is the heavenly colour. It speaks of divinity. However, there is another, deeper meaning to blue. We look at the Hebrew word for blue: “tekheleth”. This word comes from another word in Hebrew: “kahlah”. Kahlah means perfection, completeness. At the Cross, perfection is displayed, as God’s holiness kissed God’s mercy, and God’s demand met God’s provision.\nThere is one ordination that God made in Numbers 15:37-39. God commanded the Israelites to make the tassels, and you still see it in today’s Israel. In face, the Pharisees’ tassels were longer than usual, to show of their “spiritual” status.\nThe tassels on the corners of garments had a blue thread to it. Why is this significant?\nIn Luke 8:43-44, a woman with the issue of blood came to Jesus. She was poor (spent all her money on physicians) and sick, so she was doubly sorrowful. She touched the border, that is, the corner, of Jesus’ garment, and she was healed. Now, on the corners of Jesus’ garment were the tassels with a blue thread. The woman touched completion of a perfect work. Blue speaks of the finished work of Jesus, of completeness. Now, please don’t go out from church and buy blue clothes or wear the tassels; these things were outward for our study that you may know that because of Jesus’ finished work: you are complete in Him. Hallelujah!\nGood related information! I have been hunting for everything like that for quite a while currently. Regards!\nnow at this time I’am doing my best to do a study on the garments, and espicially a study on the prayer shaw,old and new covenat. any more info. u may have would be great. thankyou for all ur answers here in this segment.\nquestion:What is the significance of the color blue in the High Priest's garments according to the sermon notes?"]}
{"question_id": 33, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nJust the beginning for ”Bubba”\nby Peter Schwartz On Thu, Jun. 15, 2017\nAfter his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut, Darrell Wallace Jr. continues his journey in Michigan.\nThe reality was that “Bubba” made his Monster Energy Cup Series debut driving the famous #43 and became just the 4th African-American driver to ever participate in the highest level of NASCAR.\n“I will cheer up,” said the 23 year old Wallace after the race. “This was a wonderful day for me, a wonderful day for the sport. I wish we could have got a little bit better finish in our Smithfield Ford, but I’m just thankful for the opportunity. I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a little kid and now it’s here, and I made a name for myself. We’ll build off of it. I’ll practice more with the dash and go debrief with the team, and we’ll just get better.”\nWith those words, Wallace put it all into perspective and showed a great deal of maturity but also the passion to get better. He might have been down a bit after the race, but the magnitude of his accomplishment in getting to that moment in his career is what he will remember most about his historic day and not necessarily the speeding penalties that he attained during the course of the day.\nWith all of those thoughts racing through his head, Wallace went through a whirlwind of emotions. After the race, he had a very productive conversation with RPM Co-Owner Andrew Murstein.\n“We spoke and he was upset with the speeding penalties and he was beating himself up a little bit,” said Murstein. “I loved to see that. It tells me how hungry he is. It reminded me a little of (the movie) “Talladega Nights” and the line “If you’re not first your last.” He wants nothing short of a win eventually. I told him that every long journey starts with a first step. Pocono was his first step in what should be a long and very successful career.”\nWhile he had mixed emotions about his performance at Pocono, Wallace certainly had a lot to smile about for a couple of reasons. 1st of all, it was an historic day for him just to be in the race and his good friend Ryan Blaney notched his 1st career win driving the iconic #21 car for Woods Brother Racing.\nThe two buddies had a nice chat before the race about how getting to this point and representing these two teams was pretty surreal.\n“I loved how you had two young men in Bubba and Ryan talking before the race about how cool it was that they were driving arguably the two most prestigious numbers in the sport. They have great respect for the tradition and history of NASCAR. “That’s great to see and unfortunately is rare amount many athletes in other sports.”\nWallace will certainly remember that 1st day in a Monster Energy Cup Series race for a long time, but for the moment it’s time to turn the page and move on to the next race this Sunday in Michigan for the “FireKeepers Casino 400”. It’s a fast track that Wallace is very comfortable with.\n“I like that place,” said Wallace. “I think I run a little bit better at Michigan. I’m looking forward to it. (Pocono) is a first step. I know we ran a good, clean race, and that’s all you can ask, didn’t wreck the car, brought it home in one piece, so I’m pumped for the guys.”\nIt’s always good to see a little from an athlete, regardless of what sport it is. While Wallace was beating himself up over his mistakes at Pocono, he’s using it as motivation to get better starting this week in Michigan. The great ones have that ability to turn adversity into prosperity. “Bubba” is still climbing the ladder but has already shown what type of competitor he is.\n“I like how hungry he is and he also seems to see the big picture,” said Murstein. “The great ones have that. I often talked about that with my friend (Pro Football Hall of Famer) Jim Brown, who I took to a NASCAR race last year. He realizes that athletes can be more than just an athlete and can affect the way people view the world. Having Bubba succeed in this sport will be a great thing for everyone.”\nWallace earned this opportunity with RPM because of what he accomplished in the NASCAR XfINITY Series and Camping World Truck Series where he notched five career wins. With that 1st victory, the graduate of NASCAR’s “Drive for Diversity” program became the 1st African-American to win a NASCAR race since Hall of famer Wendell Scott.\nBut now he has reached the highest level of the sport and the competition is second to none.\n“These guys are good,” said Wallace. “These guys are here for a reason. There’s no more climbing. I’ve been in the ladder rungs for the last couple years and now I’m at the top. There’s nothing else I can do but just to go out there and just get better and better and learn how this sport works and how this series works.”\nWith RPM, Wallace is filling in for the injured Aric Almirola who is expected to return later this season after suffering a compression fracture of the T5 vertebra in a crash May 13th at Kansas Speedway. This is a golden opportunity for “Bubba” who has a chance to audition for another team or even earn a permanent role with RPM next season should they add a second car.\nIt’s only been one race for RPM, but Wallace already has a big fan in the owner’s box.\n“If we are lucky enough to have support for two cars it would be very exciting to have Bubba drive our second car,” said Murstein. “I think he will be a big star in the sport one day, with or without us. I hope it’s with us.”\nDarrell Wallace Jr. has worked very hard to get to this point. He’s already made NASCAR history but that’s only one chapter of a book he hasn’t finished writing yet. The next chapter is this Sunday in Michigan and he’ll use the rest of his opportunity with RPM to set the tone for what lies ahead next year and in years to come.\nBut it certainly looks and sounds like Wallace and Richard Petty Motorsports is a marriage made in NASCAR heaven.\nquestion:Who was the first African-American to win a NASCAR race?"]}

{"question_id": 35, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nWhen one considers all the national and global crises that dominated the 2015 headlines, 2016 has the potential to be one of those landmark years that could change history.\nIn my lifetime, 1968 falls into that category. I vividly remember that at age 13, I tried to process the urban riots and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. An emerging “women’s liberation” movement caught my interest, as I was trying to understand a new distrust of government called the “credibility gap.” But overall, it was the Vietnam War that dominated the nightly news. This was because in 1968 alone, 16,592 Americans were killed, making it the war’s deadliest year.\nFrom my suburban-Boston teenage perspective, it appeared that our nation was not only at war in Southeast Asia but fighting against itself in cities and on college campuses.\nNow, almost 48 years later, all the social, cultural, racial, global, and political upheavals that made 1968 the “year that changed everything” appear to be present again — only now on steroids — potent enough to make that tumultuous year look downright peaceful.\nIn 2015, everyone, almost simultaneously, became increasingly fed-up, ticked-off, offended, or outraged.\nThe reality of 2015 is that everyone, almost simultaneously, became increasingly fed-up, ticked-off, offended, or outraged about some personal, religious, ethnic, gender, economic, legal, global, environmental, political, media, hi-tech, sports, social, or GMO-food issue.\nAtop all that is an intense national distrust in the federal government and an increasing disdain for its growth, cost, waste, and incompetence. Moreover, given that Americans are so polarized, the government always stands accused of doing either too much or too little — screwing up, whatever your major gripe or cause happens to be, viewed from the perspective of your political leanings.\nIn response to all this mayhem, we the people have opened our virtual windows and are yelling, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore” — a flashback from the iconic 1976 movie Network — but with a new twist. Social media have become our new “window,” making it possible for us to rant and rave and show and tell everything to anyone, anywhere, at all times.\nSince 2008, when then-senator Barack Obama campaigned on the slogan “Hope and Change” — and went on win the White House on a wave of feel-good bromides — we’ve witnessed a precipitous decline in national optimism and a rise in fear.\nIn 2016, if there is a contest for an official national slogan, my entry will be “Fear and Change.” Fear is reflected in a recent Quinnipiac poll that showed 83 percent of American voters believing that it is “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that a major terrorist attack will strike the U.S. in the near future.\nFear was also the driving force in a December 14 NBC/WSJ poll that prompted 40 percent of Americans to name “national security and terrorism” as the issue that they believe should be the federal government’s top priority. This knocked “job creation and economic growth” from the number-one spot, down to number two, at 23 percent. This was a huge shift from April, when jobs and growth were cited by 29 percent as the issue that Americans believed should be the government’s top priority.\nFurthermore, this same NBC/WSJ poll found that only 20 percent of adults believe that our nation is headed in the right direction — compared with 70 percent who say it’s on the wrong track.\nThere is no doubt that negativity and fear have permeated our national psyche. Fear is fueled by the perception that our government is failing to keep us safe from terrorism and mass shootings. There is also the fear that we have lost our postwar global influence — with grave consequences yet to be realized. Perhaps the greatest long-term fear is the realization that America is rapidly changing for the worse. This is coupled with voters’ widely shared belief that they are powerless to prevent these negative changes.\nPerhaps the greatest long-term fear is the realization that America is rapidly changing for the worse.\nAll of the above is the backdrop for what is guaranteed to be a traumatic 2016 at home and abroad, while a contentious presidential election takes center stage.\nThese fear-driven attitudes explain why businessman Donald Trump — whose slogan is “Make America Great Again” — is currently leading in the race for the Republican nomination. Most of his supporters strongly believe that he is America’s last great hope.\nWith a controversial candidate such as Trump, and an unpopular candidate like Hillary Clinton, the kind of social and political discontent that sparked the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention could return with new force in 2016, erupting at one or both of the summer’s national nominating conventions.\nA major difference between 1968 and today, however, is that draft-age youth of that era were passionate, demanding an end to the Vietnam War. In 2016, fear of national decline and terrorism will be central issues, but they are not — yet — stirring up anywhere near as much passion. There is a distinct possibility, though, that the volatile issues of economic inequality, the growth of a large permanent underclass, and a demand for social justice and for criminal-justice reform among minority groups could explode at any time, creating massive national chaos.\nIn 2016, this we know for sure: No matter who is elected president, half the electorate will be convinced that our once-great nation is forever doomed.\nBut the risk of doom will be reduced if Hillary Clinton wins, because recently out on the campaign trail she said, “We’ve got to do everything we can to weed out hate and plant love and kindness.” Then, in a separate speech to African-American ministers, Clinton announced that she is running on a “love and kindness platform.”\nThis platform, along with her new campaign slogan “Love Trumps Hate,” channels that popular 1968 saying “Make Love, Not War.” Could this be Clinton’s secret strategy to defeat ISIS?\nOur nation survived 1968, but 2016 is shaping up to be even more traumatic.\n— Myra Adams is a media producer and political writer.

I’ve worked with thousands of computer consultants and routinely see them commit one major mistake in their MSP marketing plan.\nThis minor oversight kills any chance of convincing new (and existing!) customers to purchase managed services — and wastes their precious time and investment in the process.\nIt’s not an obvious mistake in their managed services marketing campaigns — like a missing headline, offer, or testimonials. It’s emotional logic and persistence.\nChange The Conversation In Your MSP Marketing Plan\nToo often, MSPs focus on what managed services is and what it does in their marketing messaging. That won’t convince anyone to do anything. Heck, most won’t take 3 seconds to read your flyer.\nTo connect with MSP leads, you have to understand where they’re coming from, and apply that emotional intelligence across your MSP marketing plan.\nUse these proven tips for more targeted and effective MSP marketing messaging:\nTap Into Customer Motivations:\nSuccessful sales boils down to understanding human motivations. People purchase for self-serving reasons. They don’t buy because they should, because it’s right, or because they need it. If that were the case, we’d all buy (and eat) healthy food, take our vitamins, invest for retirement, and kick bad habits that keep us sick, broke, and fat.\nWhen selling managed IT services, you first have to ask: What would motivate someone to buy this type of service? There are two primary MSP personas you need to acknowledge in your plan:\nCrisis Mode Customers\nIf a company experiences constant network problems, they’re more likely to buy. For this type of client, you have to demonstrate why they should trust you to solve their pain over all other available options.\nThis is why I strongly recommend a stay-in-touch marketing system for all unconverted MSP leads. You don’t know when their network will finally break, so you want to constantly stay in touch. That way, they’ll think of you when it eventually does OR when their current IT person has committed the “last straw.”\nComplacent Customers\nBut what about the client who is NOT experiencing problems? Why would they buy managed services? What would motivate them to “fix” something that ain’t broke?\nIn a sense, these types of managed IT services leads need to be “scared straight.” They need to be educated about the devastating problems that can crop up when a network is not maintained, secured, and monitored. They must feel uneasy about their data security and network health and “see” how a fatal crash would affect their business. It’s your job to convince them YOU are the one to help them avoid these fatal outcomes.\nHere are two example email marketing messages for this type of persona from my Million-Dollar Managed Services Marketing Blueprint:\nEducate to Win in MSP Sales\nThe sales landscape has shifted. You can no longer feed people messages you want them to hear. Competition for managed IT services leads is fiercer than ever, and buyers now have the upper hand.\nIf you want prospects to read your marketing and act on it, you’ll need to take the time to educate the client in a powerful, convincing, and interesting way. You can accomplish this by incorporating seminars, teleseminars, thought leadership articles, audio recordings, long sales letters, or free reports in your MSP marketing plan.\nIf you do that and constantly hammer your message home, they will (eventually) reach the purchase tipping point. I don’t know when, and some MSP customers will take longer than others. But the key is to consistently do the right things, in the right way, long enough to have impact.\nBreak The Mold And Sell More Managed Services Contracts\nTransitioning from a break-fix to managed services model is not easy. Without targeted, consistent messaging in place, you will likely lose out to another MSP who’s there when the need arises.\nI’ve helped thousands of computer consultants and MSPs emerge from the trenches and build sustainable managed services revenue models.\nAre you ready to do the same?\nMy Million-Dollar Managed Services Marketing Blueprint exposes actual campaigns and strategies that other small computer consultants have used to double or triple their annual revenue, launch a profitable managed services practice, and transform the way they do business.\nIn this program, you’ll also learn:\n- How to avoid wasting thousands of dollars on marketing campaigns that don’t work. I’ll reveal the exact marketing media proven to work best when marketing IT services.\n- How to position yourself as the most “in demand” IT consultant in your area with the highest fees and still get more business than cheaper competitors.\n- The 3 critical characteristics you must develop to unlock a flood of new MSP sales and business opportunities. These have nothing to do with your marketing, the type of clients you serve, the way you price your services, or your competition.\n- Auto-pilot marketing systems that will cut the time and effort of selling managed services in half while virtually eliminating cheap clients. This is price-shopper pest control for your business!\n- How to get every ad, sales letter, brochure marketing campaign, website – and even your business card – to generate two to three times as many leads and sales.\n- What type of marketing media is the BEST for promoting your computer consulting services, and which ones will waste your time, drain your bank account, and leave you disappointed and frustrated.\nWe provide you the necessary training, MSP marketing plan and managed services business model that works. You can implement these out-of-the-box resources on your own to increase monthly recurring revenue.\nFrom a managed service business plan, to a proposal, and even managed services contracts, we have it all.

That is not to say that it is my least favorite modern story (that's a toss-up between Kill the Moon or Sleep No More), but it's the one that not only features the Daleks but exemplifies my frustration with them. How can I miss you if you won't go away? So let's talk about that. Daleks in Manhattan (TARDIS Data Core recap) This story, set in Depression-era New York City, features a wide array of American accents ranging from passable to truly awful. It also features a guest turn by Andrew Garfield a full half-decade before he would become Spider-Man. He's not very memorable in the role. Finally, it features four Daleks - none of whom ever shout, \"EXTERMINATE!\" It's like, what's the point of being a Dalek if you aren't going to do any exterminating? These four are the Cult of Skaro, who did an emergency time shift to escape the Battle of Canary Wharf during the previous season's finale, and they are behind a lengthy plot that involves turning humans into pig-faced slaves (I have no idea why Russel T Davies is so fascinated by the idea of pig monsters, maybe he once had a bad truffle-hunting vacation to France). Their plot also involves affixing some Dalekanium plates to the top mast of the under-construction Empire State Building so that they can do a whole Frankenstein thing and create a Dalek-Human hybrid. Because, of course. It's just... not good. When the first Dalek showed up in Dalek it was a chilling episode that was masterfully written. When they came back for the first season finale it was a shocking moment. When they came back again for the second season finale it was somewhat less shocking, but generally well done. By the time Hooverville of the Daleks rolls around it marks the sixth and seventh episodes with them in two-and-a-half years. Seriously, enough already. Even the Doctor is bored with them, he can barely work up a visceral \"oh nos they are going to destroy humanity\" moment. I dunno, maybe the bad American stereotypes play better in the U.K. God knows they must think our British and Scottish stereotypes are wretched. Honestly, though, I just could not care less about the doomed love story between showgirl Tallulah and PigMan Laszlo. And the fact that the cast list includes an actual credit for \"Hero Pig\" just sums it all up. Blech. Tomorrow I will slog through the back half of the story, Wednesday I will slog through The Lazarus Experiment, and then Thursday I can get back to enjoying this project. Honestly, I'd almost rather be watching Planet of Giants right now. At least that featured Barbara Wright, Goddess.

{"question_id": 42, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nOn June 9, 15 current and retired University of Wisconsin Oshkosh College of Business (COB) faculty traveled to China for two weeks to learn more about Chinese business education and practice.\nThe trip was financed through fundraising efforts and out-of-pocket by the individual professors.\nMaking stops in Beijing, Hangzhou, Ninghai and Shanghai, the faculty focused on local Wisconsin companies that are doing business in China, including Godfrey & Kahn, Kohler, Oshkosh Corp. and Traffic Cast.\n“By visiting a variety of cities, we had the opportunity to view the phenomenal growth of monster coastal cities, such as Shanghai, and the continuation of traditional methods of farming and life in more rural areas, such as Ninghai,” said Marianne Johnson, UW Oshkosh associate economics professor.\n“We also had an opportunity to see Beijing’s preparation for the Olympics in August, including their famous Bird’s Nest Stadium, to be used for opening ceremonies, and the Water Cube,” she said.\nHigher education\nThe faculty visited two universities in Shanghai: the China-Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and Shanghai University. CEIBS is a private university that offers only graduate study in business, with an MBA and executive MBA (EMBA), as well as certificate programs. Both are ranked in the top 10 internationally for their business programs and have a number of impressive facilities, including a finance center that provides top-level consulting, research and workshops for the Chinese government and Chinese businesses.\nCEIBS is seeking accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a move that will place more limits on its structure and actions but which, the administration feels, is necessary to recruit faculty and students internationally. UW Oshkosh is the only AACSB-accredited university in northeastern Wisconsin.\nThe University of Shanghai, a public university that primarily serves local students, offers semester-long and summer study programs taught in English for business students.\nOne of the major problems facing the Chinese education system is that there are more Chinese students seeking admission to universities than there are spots available. Just prior to the faculty’s arrival, Hangzhou Foreign Language School (HFLS), an elite public high school, held its college entrance exam. The exams determine whether a student can seek admittance to a university as well as what level of university.\nUW Oshkosh’s College of Business hopes to pursue a cooperative agreement with HFLS to guarantee admittance of five students per year to UW Oshkosh’s business program.\nBusiness and industry\nThe faculty visited a number of different types of businesses. Industrial sites included a Chinese-owned textile factory; the Chinese-American-owned company PacRim that produces metal stamping and injection molding and a Kohler plant that produces faucets for the Chinese market.\n“One characteristic of all these factories was what is called ‘Chinese-style’ automation, a mix of technological and labor intensive production,” Johnson said.\nNancy Sun, PacRim CEO and president, estimated that by 2012, the Chinese comparative advantage in cheap labor will disappear and costs of production in China and Mexico will be roughly equivalent.\nPacRim is considering two strategies in anticipation of the cost shifts: opening a plant in Mexico for supplying U.S. companies as well as shifting production to more sophisticated and specialized parts for green technologies.\nAnother characteristic of the companies’ officers was a concern over rising input prices, including higher labor costs due to a new Chinese labor law requiring companies to provide a range of insurances for workers, higher commodity prices and higher energy prices.\n“We also learned that there are significant differences in government and tax treatment of Chinese-owned, joint-venture and wholly foreign-owned companies,” Johnson said. “For those thinking of producing in China, negotiating government bureaucracy, labor laws, environmental laws and so forth can be very difficult, and there are advantages and disadvantages of each type of ownership structure that bear careful investigation.”\nIn addition to factories, the faculty toured several service-provision organizations, including Wisconsin law firm Godfrey & Kahn, Nielson Market Research and Traffic Cast. Representatives of all three companies emphasized several shared themes: the rise of the Chinese middle class and of discretionary consumption and the vast differences in regional preferences and customs.\nNielson reported on the success of Pizza Hut and how the company addressed cultural differences between American and Chinese diners, such as the difficulty of selling salad to Chinese consumers. Traffic Cast provided evidence of the rising demand for consumer service products, including real-time traffic reports and forecasts.\nGovernment\nThe visiting faculty also met with governmental and international organizations, including a Wisconsin Department of Commerce representative, an officer of the U.S. Commercial Services Office and the American Chamber of Commerce president in Beijing.\n“While all were largely positive about U.S. opportunities in China, they each stressed the importance of a careful entrance strategy, whether for producing or selling in China, and cautioned us on the necessity to do very thorough background checks on potential Chinese partners,” Johnson said.\nTen years ago, most U.S. companies in China were manufacturing for the U.S. market; however, today most companies are manufacturing in China for the Chinese market — a big shift in strategy and operation, she said.\nIn Ninghai, the faculty had the chance to talk to Chinese governmental officials, including the mayor, deputy mayor and local Communist Party officials to learn about local politics and taxes. They also had the opportunity to talk to Oshkosh Corp. representatives about the business challenges of selling directly to the Chinese government as a wholly foreign-owned company.\nWhile having enormous potential, China faces a number of important challenges in coming years, including dealing with inflation, reforming the Chinese educational system to encourage more creative thinking that can be leveraged into business and product innovation, and addressing environmental concerns from manufacturing and from the rapid growth in automobile usage, Johnson said.\n“Other highlights of the trip included eating duck tongue, witnessing employee nap time at PacRim, climbing the Great Wall, visiting the Forbidden City, boating on beautiful West Lake as well as seeing Buddhist temples, Chinese gardens and the fantastically modern Pudong (in Shanghai),” she said.\nGraphic courtesy of Google Maps.\nquestion:What are the two universities in Shanghai that the faculty from University of Wisconsin Oshkosh College of Business visited?"]}

I love the way he smells of soap, toothpaste, and cologne when he leaves out to face this big.bad.world for us. I laid in bed for a while longer watching the light reflecting off the lake dance on my bedroom ceiling... how does it dooo that? Then I rolled out of bed, grabbed my red rove- you remember the one? The one James insisted I have last Christmas and promptly told me about once they came in from shopping?\nI walked through my house... the warm cypress woodwork, the fresh grey walls, the cold tile leading down the hall to James' room. I crept up to the top bunk and started kissing and smelling his head. He is all knees and elbows but his cheeks are still chubby. His fat cherub lips still pout when he sleeps. I nuzzled him until he finally woke to shrug me off. \"Momma? Daddy never does that,' he says to me in his brand new morning voice. \"I know, Love.\"\n\"Why you do that?\" he asks sort of annoyed. I sigh, trying to pick out the best reason for loving my children to death... I couldn't settle on one good reason, so I launched into something like: it's because you grew inside my belly for 9 months. It's because I lost all reason when you were born healthy and placed into my arms. It's because you are my proof that God is faithful and full of grace. It's because I watched your pensive face melt into your first smile. I felt the knobby ridge of your first tooth peek through your gummy smile that day in the bath tub. Your first step. The day you found my lipstick. The way you'd lick the top of your daddy's head when you were on his shoulders. The way you'd belly.laugh in your sling when I'd smash garlic when cooking your dinner... I watched you leave me to take your first bus ride. I held my breath as you finally returned to me that afternoon... All of this. All of these things. And all the things that will ever happen from here on out with you. It's endless. That's why.\nBy this point, we were thick into the decision of what to wear for Free Dress Day. I had several well coordinated outfits laid out for scrutiny. Naturally, none made the cut. As usual, he wanted to wear his T.Ball sliding pants and one of his football or soccer jerseys. All of which are too small for him to leave the house and go out in public. *James has grown 7 inches in the past 2.5 months. Yes, seriously. James, you don't know this, but you have 3 NFL authentic jerseys and a professional soccer jersey coming your way for Christmas. With these gifts I fully understand that I'll never get you to wear anything else ever again... I'm sure you'll be on a strict 4 outfit rotation for the rest of your life. But at least I will have the satisfaction that you will be wearing clothes that FIT. All of this in hopes to avoid the next teary FreeDress morning when I have to explain again why you can't wear your France soccer jersey to school. (Carmen, remember that jersey?) You've worn it weekly then daily since you were TWO. It has seen a good run, Dearest.\nThen after 5 more minutes of prep time, he was running out the door to catch the bus. Book sack bobbing up and down as he jogged down the driveway, across the street, then a quick pause as he gave his bus driver a High.Five.\nThe past two days I've been sadish. I'm coming off an incredibly successful and busy mustard.seed.photography year. There was no way I could expect the overwhelming response to my work. It's been amazing and I've grown so much professionally and personally. I'm 100% grateful for it all! But I'm a touch tired. I'm anxious to pause MSP work so I can recoup some much needed family time. I still have some lingering work... but for the most part, I won't be producing new work until January. I'm anxious to refocus on my family and this season. Just a mini.holiday respite.\nWhich brings me to the fact that each year that passes, my boys get a year older. James will be FIVE years old in 19 days.\nMaybe because he was my first... or the fact that I had a high.risk pregnancy... or because he followed a miscarriage... or because he was born at the most nostalgic time of the year... I always get emotional around his birthday. It's not a marked 'sadness' but it is an overwhelming sense of gratefulness.\nMy life changed the day he was born. I became myself when he was born. Then I think about where Marcus and I were when we became parents. Our love. Our hopes. Our finances or lack of. It makes me swell up inside. God gifted US with James... and our lives have never been the same. Everyday is filled with an unconditional, tangible Love that we never could have expected. And that Love became Jackson... and will become our daughter as we make our way to her. As a woman, nothing has ever compared to the Purpose I feel tending my nest and my bitties.\nAnd when I reflect on this transformation and the Hope that I feel moving forward raising up these boys... I am undone. For a spell. A day or two.\nI'm hoping a weekend steeped in family festivities with my three boys will help my aching heart.\nPeace, love, and gingerbread.\nxo\nlmkw\nquestion:What is the reason the narrator gives her son for loving him so much?"]}

Corner windows are a trend, says JELD-WEN’s Jennifer Matson. “For larger windows, like in living areas, fixed windows are just fine. We can make an inoperable window larger than one that operates. It just comes down to the weight of the glass.”\n“Everybody wants more glass and less frame,” says Joe LeFlore, South Florida Millwork vice president. “Bigger is better. I got five plans today and every one is floor-to-ceiling windows.” LeFlore notes that a lot of manufacturers are doing away with grids and muntins to increase the windows’ viewing area.\n“And screens are going away.” While screens are always an option, he says that many people just don’t want them, and don’t want the hassle of storing something they won’t use.\nThe trend toward black frames on both the interior and exterior of windows continues to charm, while painted metallic frames are surging. Painted versus an actual metal frame is the preference because while home buyers may like the look, committing to a frame they may tire of in a few years is a concern. Especially since aluminum windows are costly to thermal break, says Matson, JELD-WEN’S director of product line management for wood windows.\nBlack seems here to stay, but the palette for other darker colors is expanding. “I’ve seen the darker colored frames like dark brown and barn red and dark greens, and wood is really the substrate for that,” says Matson. “We have refreshed that interior sash palette with gray—and it may shift to a warmer brown-gray—and some stains. We also do custom colors.”\nEven in production building, where keeping costs in line is often at odds with trends, Philadelphia architect Jim Wentling will use smaller square windows as accents, usually in a Craftsman-style home, or a ribbon window in a ranch-style home.\nFlorida architect Tony Weremeichik likes to use floor-to-ceiling glass. “That’s tough for production builders, but they can swap them out for double-hung units and gang them.” To meet buyers’ expectations, Weremeichik suggests builders try to get as much glass in their homes as possible within their means and budget.\nFor assistance with your 2019 projects, including incorporating window trends such as these, visit JELD-WEN’s professional portal.\nquestion:What are the window trends for 2019 according to the context?"]}

With this, various sectors which are reopening have also put in place high safety standards to give people the confidence to embrace this new normal.\nAs Malaysians adapt to the idea of travelling in the new normal, Grab has seen an increase in demand for rides. Therefore, Grab is sharing an updated 6-step guide to safer rides with GrabProtect which are based on the various efforts introduced to ensure safety for both users as well as our partners.\nElaborating on this, Rashid Shukor, Head of Operations at Grab Malaysia adds, “Malaysians are getting back to their daily routines and we have observed more people are out and taking rides more frequently. As a platform that aims to provide convenient and safe transport options, we have put in place our GrabProtect policy to protect the health and safety of our users . Through this we hope to give greater peace of mind to our community as the public continue to embrace this new normal and our driver-partners continue to earn via the platform.\nCommitment to health and safety for greater peace of mind\nGrabProtect is an initiative that helps reinforce higher safety and hygiene standards on our platform. We are focused on getting you to your destination efficiently and as safely as possible.\nThe health and safety measures in the GrabProtect 6 steps to safer rides include:\n- Health declaration form – All driver- and delivery-partners, as well as passengers are required to complete their health declaration before they can start driving, delivery orders or book a ride. Drivers will be required to complete the online health and hygiene declaration at least once a day, whereas passengers will be required to do so before every ride booking.\n- Mandatory face mask – Grab driver- and delivery-partners are required to wear a mask whenever they are on the Grab platform and the same requirement will be extended to passengers. If either party shows up without a mask on, passengers and driver-partners can cancel the booking by selecting “driver/passenger did not wear a mask” as their cancellation reason.\n- In-car sanitisation – Grab has ensured that driver and delivery-partners are equipped with masks and hygiene kits to protect their vehicles and delivery bags. Car and delivery bag disinfection services will also be made available, at a subsidised fee, to Grab drivers- and delivery-partners at selected locations.\n- Trip Monitoring – To ensure the safety of both driver-partners as well as passengers, Grab uses various signals to detect anomalies during a ride. This includes monitoring trip signals such as GPS, traffic conditions and map intelligence. Details will be shared with the authorities if the safety of passengers or driver-partners are at risk.\n- Emergency Button – Provides a one-stop tap to get immediate assistance, 24/7, 365 days a year. Given your response, police or ambulance units will be dispatched. Passengers can also add and enable Emergency Contacts from the settings icon who will be automatically alerted if they tap on the emergency button.\n- Share My Ride – This feature allows passengers to share their ride details with loved ones via a shareable link. Tapping on the link will then open a web page where the ride details can be tracked\nOnly driver-partners and passengers with Low Risk (Risiko Rendah) and Casual Contact No Symptom (Kontak Kasual Tidak Bergejala) on their MySejahtera COVID-19 risk status are eligible to use Grab’s e-hailing service. In addition to these health and safety precautions, GrabInsure has also collaborated with Chubb to offer free Covid-19 Post Vaccination Insurance, with coverage of up to RM7,800 for Malaysian residents (including our driver- and delivery-partners). For more information and to enroll, please click HERE.\nGenerating Demand to Boost Local Economy\nIn support of the nation’s efforts to restart the domestic travel industry, Grab has launched various campaigns and promotions to provide more value to domestic travelers as they re-discover Malaysia.\nFor safer rides, Grab is introducing a special promotion for domestic travelers via flights. From now to 31 December 2021, users will be able to enjoy up to RM10 OFF when booking from or to selected airports across the country.\nGrab’s various promotions also enable travelers to continue experiencing the best of local culture wherever they may be. Some examples of this include:\n- Minggu Peniaga Kecil – a monthly campaign to encourage consumers to support small and local brands on GrabFood while enjoying savings.\n- Shop Malaysia Online – Grab continues to support the government’s Shop Malaysia Online effort with offers that enable consumers to save up to 50% across GrabFood, GrabMart and GrabPay services.\nAs Malaysia recovers, Grab is committed to innovating our technology to cater to both our partners and consumers who depend on the platform for convenient access to their needs.\n*For more information on Grab’s safety policies in place, please visit:\nquestion:What are some of the safety measures included in Grab's GrabProtect initiative?"]}

She's telling me she'll be singing mostly her signature tunes in her Seattle show, but that she'll also throw in a few surprises.\nTo even get to this point, I've had to promise her people not to discuss alcohol, rehab, or The Ex-Husband That Dare Not Speak His Name. I've also had to allow her manager, Danny, to listen in on the conversation from his mobile phone to ensure that I'll adhere to those promises. I'm not thrilled with the ground rules, though I agree to them. Come on—it's Liza Minnelli. I'm not gay enough to have all her albums, but I am certainly gay enough to want to start an article with \"I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli.\"\nShe sounds exactly like you think she does—warm, weird, gushing, grand, punctuating her sentences with random bursts of happy laughter and responding to every question with an emphatic sincerity that is in some strange way both less real and more fabulously genuine than the way you or I talk. Danny, meanwhile, has sworn to be \"a fly on the wall\" during the interview. Quickly, it becomes obvious that the fly he's referring to is Jeff Goldblum in the Cronenberg film. Danny carefully hovers for the length of the brief, cheerfully uneventful conversation, either in fear for his life, in fear for hers, or maybe, some complex combination of the two:\nSeattle Weekly: So, is this a mini-tour?\nLiza Minnelli: Yeah, we're playing—how many dates, Danny?\nDanny: There's a total of seven dates right now.\nMinnelli: I haven't been out West for a while, and I wanted to come back and do that.\nDanny: Yes, exactly.\nMinnelli: Yes!\nTo be honest, I'm surprised to hear Liza is even coming. Everybody knows she's been through a lot of late; hell, \"been through a lot\" has been her lot throughout four decades of giving her all. Performers are a dime a dozen now, but what they do doesn't involve the same kind of sweat it did back when Liza was learning her game, when people made their whole lives about entertaining, whole lives that seemed outrageously larger than the ones the rest of us were living—a bit of engaging fantasy that reality TV has pummeled into oblivion. You're supposed to be jaded and ironic now when you talk about such people. But ladies like Liza have all my respect for what must be exhausting self-awareness.\nI wonder out loud if she ever feels like, Hell, I've had it—I don't want to do this anymore.\nShe sounds honestly horrified.\n\"No!\" she gasps, also a bit amused at the absurdity of such an idea. \"No, I've never felt that in my life! The music is such fun, and the acting within the music—and the rapport with an audience. It's . . . an art, sort of. I don't mean to sound stuck-up, but it's a craft I learned when I was 14, 15, 16, and . . . how can I explain it? It's just what I do.\" She roars with laughter.\nDanny interjects. \"It's what you do, and it's what you do fabulously!\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liza responds demurely.\nAnyway. It must be odd, I say, to be renowned as a live entertainer in an age when people can get their 15 minutes of fame on Survivor.\n\"Well, if that's true, I've had the longest 15 minutes in the world, I'll tell ya!\" she hoots.\nBut doesn't she worry about keeping up with the all changes in the industry?\n\"I don't, really, no,\" she says. \"But, you know, when you think about it, I'm a performing artist who's never had a hit record. There aren't any others. People have a hit record, then they go out and perform. I'm an entertainer.\"\nWhat has she noticed that's different now about entertainment?\n\"I think it's braver now,\" she says. \"I think you can do things and say things onstage, and sing songs about things, that you couldn't [before]. But, you know, I've always just done it the way I've always done it, which is, I find the song, I find the character. I write a little background for her: What kind of clothes does she wear? What is her kitchen like? Does she have decals on the fridge? And it's very detailed so that I totally inhabit the character.\"\nIs there anything she'd like to do that she hasn't done yet?\n\"Take a nap!\" she howls.\n\"Isn't that the truth?!\" agrees Danny. \"Take a long nap! We all want to take a nap!\"\nShe rather charmingly admits that she's spent her entire career wondering if she was ever going to get hired again.\n\"Really?\" I say. \"What did you think after winning the Oscar for Cabaret?\"\n\"I thought, 'This is never gonna happen again,'\" she swears, the laughter returning. \"But you have humor about it. You have to.\"\nSpeaking of which, it has to be weird constantly seeing herself impersonated in pop culture—there's even someone playing her right now on Broadway in the campy Hugh Jackman musical The Boy From Oz.\n\"I haven't seen any of it,\" she insists.\nShe hasn't?!\n\"No!\"\nWell, what does she think about it?\nA brief pause.\n\"I think I should be getting paid!\" she hollers, roaring again.\n\"Good for you!\" cries Danny.\nThen they're both off the phone and Liza, I presume, heads back out into the world to do what she does—fabulously.\nswiecking@seattleweekly.com\nLiza Minnelli plays Pier 62/63 at 7 p.m. Fri., Aug. 20. $55.\nquestion:What does Liza Minnelli say she will be performing in her Seattle show?"]}

The Cleveland electronics company stocks about 400,000 items--computers, circuits, and semiconductors--which it ships to resellers, manufacturers, and corporations worldwide. IBM, Compaq, and Intel alone account for about 60% of sales.\nTwo Big Board-listed Pioneer rivals--$2.7 billion Arrow Electronics and $1.9 billion Avnet--have a lock on about 50% of the market. That makes third-ranked Pioneer, with its $300 million market cap, a likely buyout candidate, according to Shadek. \"I don't think it's a stretch to think you'd get 20 [a share],\" he says. Pioneer currently trades at 11 5/8, down from its 52-week high of 18 3/4 on Mar. 1.

Members of the media and photographers took videos and photos of the group—in this video, you can hear Yahoo News reporter Brittany Shepherd asking, “Are you any closer to making a cabinet decision?” to which Biden responds, “Yes.”\nSign up for Bicycling All Access, and we’ll let you know every time Biden is spotted on a bike\nBiden appeared to be riding a Trek FX hybrid, and a well-loved one from the looks of it. From what we could see in the photos, it had a Bontrager cockpit, linear pull rim brakes, and a rusty chain well past its prime. He came prepared for the ride with a headlight, and all of the bike’s reflectors are still intact (he’s the president-elect, he can do what he wants)..\nWe can’t tell exactly what bike Jill is riding, but it looks to be similar to Biden’s—something functional and affordable. Affixed to her handlebar is an Axiom Seymour Handlebar Bag created with fabric made out of recycled fishing nets, as well as a small headlight. While Biden’s bike has a rigid fork, Jill’s is equipped with an RST suspension fork, leading us to believe she likes to get a little more sendy than the president-elect.\nJill is wearing a Liv Rev Comp MIPS helmet and a jacket with the logo of Pelotonia, a charity ride in Ohio that raises money for cancer research, at which Biden gave a send-off speech in 2017. And everyone riding in this group is wearing a mask, which is important, given the rising cases of COVID-19 around the country.\nThe last time the media was shouting to Biden on a bike was in August, when he was riding the same Trek in Delaware. Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked the then-candidate if he’d chosen a running partner yet. Biden said he had, and when Doocy asked who, he jokingly responded “You!” (spoiler alert: it was not him).\nWe’re stoked that our president-to-be and future first lady are into cycling, and will be on high alert for any more #RidinWithBiden in the news.\nquestion:What type of bike was president-elect Joe Biden riding on his trip to Cape Henlopen State Park?"]}

The topic of demographics and statistics came up and it got me thinking. How often do public libraries use public demographics/statistics and/or ask for statistics from political parties? Could this data prove useful? Politicians use this data to determine where to campaign and where a certain percentage of voters typically live. Depending on the county, city, district, area, etc., library funds are often voted on by the people and/or decided by a governing board; knowing as much as possible about the people in the community has unknown value. A basic identity can be uncovered and some collections can then be geared towards that. However, the library would have to market the changes appropriately. Just as a politician goes door to door, sends out mailers, and has voices in neighborhoods speaking on their behalf- so too should the library.\nI understand that many libraries use this type of data but to what extent? Most certainly do not go as deep as politicians. Politicians employ specialist in organizing this data and lining it up with a campaign plan. Librarians though are armed with a skill set that would make tackling such an endeavor simple. A phone call to a local official would be a good start. The library wants to reach out to the people and an elected official would want the same. Perhaps the library could set up an appointment with the official’s campaign manager or a specialists from their campaign. It’s a win-win situation and most importantly a win for the public.\nquestion:How do politicians use public demographics and statistics data?"]}

Peering through the misty windows on the top deck of the bus from Shanklin to Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, trying to make out the sea between the wind-swept trees and the pretty thatched cottages on a cold damp May day.\nThis is how Mark Baker (53) recalls the moment when he first began to seriously think about investing in a holiday let.\n“We’d had a terrible holiday weather-wise earlier on in the year and we were running out of indoor activities to do with the kids and that’s when we decided to catch the bus and do a tour of the Island,“ says Mark, an IT manager from Chobham in Surrey. “My mind had begun to wander about retirement as I was looking at the houses – I know it’s still a few years off but I do need to start planning for the future. I can’t see myself living on the Island permanently when I retire but yet I am pulled to this beautiful place.\n“That’s when I thought about holiday homes and Brexit – my feeling is that more people may start holidaying in this country especially if the pound does become weaker against the Euro. To me a buy-to-let holiday investment makes sense and also I can see us coming over here more often as a family.”\nInvestors such as Mark are becoming increasingly attracted to the holiday buy-to-let market not only because of Brexit but also possibly because of new tax rules, lending criteria and the success of service accommodation and Airbnb, believes Lee from OnPoint Mortgages.\n“We have found that there has certainly been more of an interest in the buy-to-let holiday market recently. This may also be because of the Pridential Regulation Authority enforcing stricter lending requirements on buy-to-let loans, and also new taxes on rental revenue.”\nWith a holiday-let you can still offset your full mortgage interest repayments against tax.\n“Under HM Revenue & Customs rules, the property must be available for letting for at least 210 days in the year and be let for at least 105 days. But unlike conventional buy-to-lets, you can also use your holiday home for as much as 20 weeks a year.\n“There are other benefits too such as deducting the cost of doing up a property from your pre-tax profits and you don’t have to pay council tax on the property. With a buy-to-let holiday home you can also avoid local business rates.”\nLee says that most buy-to-let lenders do not consider holiday lets because the property will not be let on an assured shorthold tenancy of between six and 12 months. OnPoint mortgages does, however, offer buy-let-mortgage products through lenders like Principality Building Society and Leeds Building Society.\n“Before considering a holiday home, it’s important to to take into account factors such as the type of market you are aiming at and how practical it is physically getting to the property. If you are going to be doing the maintenance yourself consider whether you would be happy to drive for several hours to get to your property, spend all the weekend doing the decorating and then drive all the way back home, ready for work the next day.\n“If you don’t want to maintain the property yourself, you may want to find a local maintenance company to look after the it and also a cleaner who could come in on change-over days.\n“You will need to think about how you are going to market your property, such as through your own website or use a holiday lettings specialist.”\nLee also advises to look for areas which are being invested in, such as the development of new flats and shops.\nFor would-be investor Mark, he is now considering different properties on the south Island as possible holiday-lets.\n“We’re having fun looking at properties and I can’t wait to have more holidays here!”\nOnPoint Mortgages offers a range of mortgages including for those looking to enter the buy-to-let holiday market.\nPrincipality\nLeeds Building Society.\nquestion:What are some of the benefits of investing in a holiday-let property according to Mark Baker and Lee from OnPoint Mortgages?"]}

{"question_id": 58, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nRetail-isation of Barclays continues\nNews on Tuesday that Barclays had acquired the deposits, mortgages and business assets of consumer bank ING Direct UK, subject to regulatory approval, is consistent with the marked attempt to rebalance the group away from investment banking since retail banker Antony Jenkins took over as CEO.\nIFR Editor-at-large Keith Mullin\nThrough the acquisition, the bank picked up £10.9bn (around US$17.5bn) of deposits at par along with a £5.6bn mortgage book at a 3% discount.\nWith customer deposits of £113.9bn (US$182bn) as of June 30, the acquisition certainly isn’t a game-changer for Barclays in a numbers sense.\nBut it comes a little more than a week after Jenkins stacked the group executive committee away from investment banking by splitting his old retail job into two and appointing both incumbents (Valerie Soranno Keating, CEO of Barclaycard; and Ashok Vaswani, former CEO of UK Retail and Business Banking now responsible for retail and business products and services) to the group ExCom.\nThat’s certainly a radical transformation from Bob Diamond’s ExCom, which had himself, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier from the investment bank in the inner circle. To my way of thinking, that was about right since the CIB division made and continues to make the majority of group profits.\nSince taking over, Jenkins had made broadly positive noises about the importance of the investment bank. But when he appointed Soranno Keating and Vaswani, he said the changes “reflect the importance of our retail businesses for Barclays and will make for a better balance between business and functional representation on the Executive Committee”.\nStreamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting\nI don’t know about better balance: of the four global business-line heads on the 10-strong committee; two hail from the retail and business banking side (sharing 41.5% of revenues and 38% of pre-tax profits between them using interim 1H12 numbers); Tom Kalaris, CEO of Wealth & Investment Management, has less than 6% of revenues and 2.7% of profits, while Ricci is now the only representative of the corporate and investment bank, which generates close to 53% of revenues and 59% of profits.\nThat’s not better balance; that’s unbalanced and it certainly bodes ill for the investment bank in terms of Ricci’s room for manoeuvre and ability to influence outcomes.\nStreamlining (read: cutting?)\nAt the same time, Ricci has been tasked with streamlining the corporate and investment bank. Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting. Jenkins has already said he would exit activities that cause reputational risk. It’s not clear specifically what he means by that – outside areas such as tax advisory, which has been widely criticised as facilitating large-scale tax avoidance. But cuts to the CIB are widely expected.\nAs for Ricci’s shake-up of the CIB at the end of last week, it all seemed sensible enough. The big winners were Frenchman Eric Bommensath, head of the newly combined FICC and equities global markets businesses; and Tom King, most recently head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global corporate finance and M&A.\nBommensath has taken over the global equities mantle formerly held by Jerry Donini as well as responsibility for global distribution, a role formerly held by Guglielmo Sartori di Borgoricco who is leaving the bank. How Bommensath structures the team beneath him will be key. A fixed-income man through and through – and a derivatives specialist at that – he’ll need to put some decent firepower in place to make sure equities doesn’t get crushed under the weight of the FICC platform.\nThat firepower won’t be in the form of Donini, though, since the former head of equities shifted to become COO of the CIB in a move that kind of looks like one of those face-saving moves to avoid him having to report to Bommensath.\nInvestment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments\nKing has been singled out for greatness. A 20-year Citigroup man and M&A rainmaker, he only joined Barclays in October 2009 but he was promoted into the waiting room of deputy head of IB before he takes over from Skip McGee in 2013 when McGee’s day-job shifts to running CIB in the Americas away from his current slot as global head of investment banking. McGee, the former Lehman man, will keep his hat in the IB ring, though, by taking over as chairman.\nI wonder whether King will continue the streamlining of the investment banking group that McGee had kicked off in April when the corporate finance and M&A groups were merged under the trio of Tom King and Ros Stephenson (formerly co-heads of corporate finance) and Paul Parker, global head of M&A.\nThe merger made sense, as M&A execution was previously managed separately from corporate finance, which housed the industry sector and coverage teams.\nRicci has gone for a matrix of regional CEOs working alongside – or is that against? – global product heads. Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments. (I also wonder about the sense of shifting McGee, a classic Wall Street investment banker, into an operational management role).\nThe rise of three regional CEOs will certainly engage more of Larry Wieseneck’s time. In another April change, Wieseneck had moved out of his former role as head of Global Finance & Risk Solutions (ECM, DCM, leveraged finance and loans) to become head of strategy for the CIB in a role designed to ensure better alignment between businesses and regions.\nWith only four of the 13 people sitting on Ricci’s CIB executive committee sporting functional business-line responsibilities versus three with regional responsibilities, it’ll be an interesting balance. And to that point, having Larry Kantor sitting on the CIB ExCom as head of research with a direct line into Ricci is an anomaly relative to how other investment banks are structured.\nMost research heads fall under the global markets function. I wonder if that’s the way Barclays will go as it continues to move forward. If so, that’ll make the region/product split 3-3. Could be a classic divide-and-rule construct.\nHave your say\nTo have your say, you have to be signed in\nquestion:Who took over as CEO of Barclays and initiated a shift towards retail banking?"]}

When she moved back to Idaho several years ago, she stayed with my brother for a month and drove him nuts with all her ideas of what he needed/should do to decorate his house. He still bitches about that. When James died and she saw my house for the first time, she offered some suggestions as to what I should do with it which I just ignored. For me, it is not so much the decor that matters but the feel. And my house feels like a home. Even with James gone, you can still feel the love when you walk in the door. (Once you get past the excitement of the boys, who you would think have never seen people before, that is).\nBut as part of the grief recovery process, I do feel it wouldn't hurt to add a few feminine touches here and there as part of that whole making the house \"mine\" instead of \"ours\" thing. My friend offered to help me with that, which I wisely did not tell my mother when she told me about this season's curtain scheme (blue, I think. I wasn't really listening). I would have gotten another lecture on how I need to get some pretty curtains. My mom is very big on her curtains. I don't want curtains-I have really cool wood blinds. Well, they look like wood anyway. My friend and I have looked at a couple of stores and I have pointed out a few things I like so she is keeping that in the back of her mind when she is out and about. She changes her house around from time to time and it always looks nice so I trust her. And yes, she does have curtains. But just on one window. She has blinds on the rest.\nToday on my way home, I stopped to get a birthday present for a friend and ended up getting a few things for myself. I really shouldn't have spent the money, but I justified it by everything I bought for myself being 20% off.\nThe first thing I got was a 12\" x 12\" square wall hanging with a seashell in the middle that says \"It's not what you look at that matters,\" down most of the left side and \"it's what you see.\" across most of the bottom. The shell looks like it is sitting on a antique yellow fabric square and the background behind it is different blues and browns. I am going to put this in my master bathroom, which is light blue with a darker marble looking blue counter. I have always thought some sort of nautical theme would work in there. My real reason for putting this in there, however, is so I will see it when I am getting ready in the morning and remind myself to really look at the person I am-not just the package I come in.\nThe second thing I got is a small plaque (about 9\" x 4\") that has a small blue butterfly in the lower left corner and a weird purple and blue flower with a green stem and leaves on the right side that says \"Life is a journey not a Destination\" on the left above the butterfly. I am not yet sure where this is going to go; I am thinking maybe by James' picture and his urn for now. It is a reminder to take the time to enjoy life now and not worry so much about getting to my future.\nThe last plaque I got is also small-about 5\" x 7\"- and has a daisy at the top and one of my new found favorite quotes in the middle: \"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.\" It says Dance across the bottom. As any fan of Grey's Anatomy can tell you, sometimes you just have to dance it out. I am thinking about finding a spot here in the office for this one. This is my reminder to learn to find and appreciate the good in life even when it all seems to be going downhill.\nThere was one other plaque I was really tempted to get. It says \"I am not a fast cook and I am not a slow cook. I am a half-fast cook.\" I'm actually a pretty decent cook; I just thought that was really funny, especially when you say it out loud. The sale goes for another couple of days. I may have to go back for that.\nWith what little I have done so far, I have come to realize that no matter what I put on the walls or how many rooms I paint, James' essence will still be here and I am more than fine with that. It's what makes my house my home. But making my home a little more girly (I am SO not a girly girl) won't hurt anything and could actually be fun. But don't tell Mom I said that.\n1 comment:\nOh Heather, I LOVE to decorate!!! It is my Calling!! I wish so much we lived closer. We would have so much fun together. I would drag your but out of the house and to the local Michaels and show you a real craft store. Beautiful stuff. I make my own wreaths and decorations. A lot less now that I have two small children, but I try to do what I can. I enjoy decorating for Holidays, but this year will SUCK big time since it will be the first one without my sister.:( I don't know how I am going to get through Christmas without her, it was our favorite time of year. Once you start decorating the place to suit you, you will enjoy it more and more. You are so used to taking into consideration that you had a man around and not to make it too \"girly\", I think you lost track of the fun in it. You can decorate with out being girly. I use alot of dark, leafy colors in my decor. I want to see pictures when you do decorate!!!! I love to get new ideas. Good Luck!!!\nquestion:What are the three items the person bought for their house?"]}
{"question_id": 62, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nIn the previous post I cited a tool for Photoshop I’m working on – which is currently on its beta cycle, thanks to the people of Colortheory. Basically, it’s a Photoshop script that lets you control separately both Amount and Radius for Unsharp Mask filter’s Dark and Light halos: that is, you can apply USM 500% and 1.5px for Dark Halos and 300%, 0.9px for Light ones, tweaking sliders on a single GUI.\nBeing it a Script and not a Filter means that I have to drive Photoshop behind the scenes while you play with the interface (I don’t have pixel access, it would require a programming knowledge exceeding my skills). In other words I must find a way to replicate with layers and filters that very effect; not only, the scheme update must be easy, because I can’t afford the whole processing to be time consuming (otherwise the live-update performance of the tool would degrade).\nThat is to say: I won’t follow the steps outlined in the post #1 of the series – producing two halo maps via Calculations, which would require a new calculation each time the user changes a single value. I need on-the-fly updatable parameters – I’m afraid I need Smart Objects (SO). I’m not particularly fond of SO – yet they provide Smart Filters (SF) which fit perfectly my requirements: SF are Filters applied non-permanently to a SO, i.e. you can decide to change their parameters anytime, or switch them on/off.\nGiven this framework, how would you deal with SO and SF to split USM dark and light halos? There are at least two easy and intuitive ways that may came to your Photoshop-driven mind (they came to mine, too) – yet they’re wrong; this post is just about this – how not to be fooled by appealing, easy paths.\nBlending modes: Darken / Lighten\nLet me use this exciting picture as an example:\nReminder: to convert a layer in a Smart Object, right click on the layer’s name in the Layers palette and choose Convert to Smart Object. Be aware that if you right click on the layer’s icon the option does not show (there must be good reasons that I miss for that). Alternatively, via menu: Layer – Smart Objects – Convert to Smart Object.\nThat said, if you duplicate the Background layer, convert it to SO, apply the Unsharp Mask Filter (USM, say 500% 10px, we’ll always leave Threshold untouched) and set the SO blending mode to Lighten, this is what you get:\nSame concept but a different USM (500%, 30px) blended in Darken:\nSo what would we get if we mix the two?\nExactly what you would have expected – that’s it, we’re done splitting dark and light halos. With a caveat: what if we reverse the layer’s order (Lighten top, Darken bottom)?\nUhm, it doesn’t work anymore. So the trick is to keep the SO with the bigger USM Radius on top of the other – easy peasy.\nAlas, I should have been more careful, because I’ve based a good deal of coding time on this paradigm (two SO in Darken / Lighten) just to discover that it is flawed. What a unhappy business! Not to mention what my wife has been repeating me (she used to work as a programmer): “Did you test it? You did it not enough. Test it more or you’ll waste your time later. Don’t complain, I told you this before: test it!” She’s been in charge of testing, as you may guess.\nBut… why it doesn’t work? The example I’ve showed is misleading because as a test it is not exhaustive one: I’ve changed one parameter only – the Radius, keeping the Amount full blast at 500% What happens for instance if I lower back the Amount of Dark halos to 100%? No matter how I would set the layers order, the result does not match my expectations:\nFirst row (Lighten on top) is obviously flawed because it erases the Darken effect – the dark halo is wrong. Middle row (Darken on top) is not correct too, because the light halo is slightly darkened by the dark halo: it’s subtle because I’ve used a low Amount. Check out the last row to compare them with the right effect. Back to square one.\nMultiple Smart Filters\nA single SO can support more than one SF (how many, frankly I don’t know). A nice idea could be to apply two rounds of USM as SF to the same SO, fading them to Darken / Lighten. To fade a SF, click on the “lines-and-arrows” icon at the right of the “Unsharp Mask” label of the Smart Filter.\nThere’s a detail that prevent this one to work, though. SFs don’t operate in parallel, but in sequence: that is, the first USM round acts on the original SO (as expected); the second USM round operates on the result of the first SF, i.e. upon an already sharpened version. No matter how you set the SF stack order (in the following image: first Darken top, second Lighten top), the result is wrong.\nSo what?\nAs a consequence of these experiments and in a bad mood for the time wasted coding a flawed paradigm (lesson learned: test extensively! Don’t get excited when things apparently work!), I’ve had to resort to some… trickier solutions – which I’ll show you in the next post of the series.\nThe Decomposing Sharpening series has been written as a research project for my script DoubleUSM: multi-radius sharpening. You might be interested also in Fixel Detailizer 2PS: multi-frequency contrast booster.\nquestion:What is the main issue with using two Smart Objects in Darken / Lighten mode for splitting dark and light halos in Photoshop?"]}

Died: 15 January, 2013, in Edinburgh, aged 59\nSusan Manning was an intellectual dynamo whose love of words generated an influence that extended around the world.\nAs Grierson Professor of English Literature and director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) at Edinburgh University, her contribution was huge, but beyond that, she was known internationally through her work on transatlantic literature, the Scottish Enlightenment and with the Confucius Institute.\nAn academic with a rare knack of seamlessly combining her talents as a scholar, manager and mentor, she was a brilliant researcher, inspiring teacher and an excellent administrator and organiser, yet remained humble in success.\nThe daughter of medical physicist James Valentine and his wife Honora, a philosophy graduate, she was educated at John Mason High School in Abingdon near Oxford, after her parents had moved south when she was nine. As a teenager she excelled in science and humanities, achieving perfect O-level grades in both fields. But she followed her instincts at A-level, deciding to study English. Literature’s gain greatly exceeded science’s loss.\nAfter capping her schooldays with an exceptional final year, in which she became head girl, she took the then unusual step of taking a gap year. She spent time visiting Canada and Paris and Grenoble in France before going up to read English at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she graduated with a BA in 1976, around the same time as marrying physicist Howard Manning.\nShe then embarked on a PhD on Scottish and American literature, studying in the National Library of Scotland and then winning a Harkness Fellowship, which took her to Charlottesville in Virginia where she studied under distinguished Americanist David Levin. She and Howard went on to have their first child, Laura, in the States. On her return to Cambridge, she took up a research fellowship at Newnham College in 1981, becoming a college lecturer in 1984 and later faculty lecturer.\nShe also continued her doctorate studies, gaining her PhD in 1986 and joking that it had not taken ten years but three children – with Lindsay and Sophie having completed her family. Remaining at Newnham for the best part of 20 years, she skilfully pursued her career in English along with motherhood; Sophie attended her first college seminar in a carrycot, aged just three weeks.\nFollowing a bout of meningitis, Prof Manning was diagnosed with lupus but, undeterred, continued to live as full a life as possible. Latterly she ignored her lack of circulation to spend three hours snorkelling on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – an experience that rendered the great wordsmith almost speechless.\nIn 1999 she moved to Edinburgh to take up the Grierson Chair in English Literature. She also held the directorship of IASH there for seven years, from 2005, having previously been research director and postgraduate director in the School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures.\nA serious bowel operation, a lung disease and the ravages of lupus failed to slow her and she made IASH a vibrant centre for multidisciplinary studies. It gave full scope to her administrative genius and range of interdisciplinary skills – and afforded her an international reach.\nShe was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, as well as a Trustee of the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which sends scholars to further study in the US, and the Rothschild Fellowships in Jerusalem.\nIn addition she was a trustee of Edinburgh University Press, and a member of the Gifford Lectureships committee and the research committee of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. She also served on the advisory board of the Edinburgh Confucius Institute and of several scholarly editions and journals including the Edinburgh edition of the Waverley Novels, the Stirling/South Carolina edition of the Works of James Hogg, and the Cambridge University Press Studies in Romanticism series.\nShe co-edited a monograph series on transatlantic literary studies and was a board member and past president of the Eighteenth-Century Scottish Studies Society and a board member of the international body, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes.\nHer own research interests were primarily in the Scottish Enlightenment and in Scottish-American literary relations, the subjects of her books The Puritan-Provincial Vision and the transatlantic study Fragments of Union. She co-ordinated the Carnegie-funded STAR (Scotland’s Transatlantic Relations) initiative and convened its seminar and research projects. Along with Dr Nicholas Phillipson she also convened a three-year research project on The Science of Man in Scotland, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, which led to an essay collection on Character, Self and Sociability in the Scottish Enlightenment.\nHer monograph on The Poetics of Character: A Transatlantic Literary History will be published posthumously. She completed it in the Old Lobster House, in Lower Burnmouth, near Eyemouth, which she and her husband had recently completed refurbishing.\nHer premature death, following a stroke, has been felt keenly around the world by those who admired a woman whose charm, intellect, humanity and generosity left an imprint on countless colleagues and former students.\nProf Manning was buried in woodland on Edinburgh’s Corstorphine Hill after a service full of poems, reminiscence and music, including her beloved Bach cello suites, which she always said straightened out her brain waves.\nShe is survived by her husband, Dr Howard Manning, their daughters, Laura, Lindsay and Sophie, granddaughter Poppy, her mother Honora, sister Claire and brother John.\nAlmost Done!\nBy registering you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of the website.\nquestion:What were Susan Manning's main research interests?"]}

Hunt Fellowship proposal was conceived and written in that spirit. We set out to write a trio of stories that all dealt with health issues faced by communities in the Midwest that had seen an increase in their Latino populations in the past decade. Our proposal said we would write stories about the degree to which federal agencies did or did not protect workers and their families in these areas, would look at access to health insurance in a couple of Chicago neighborhoods that had high numbers of Latino residents working full time, and would delve into the issue of trauma and resilience resulting from migrants’ journeys north.\nFor the enforcement piece our objective was to build a that we would combine with census, jobs and environmental databases and food recalls. Our intention was to use what we built not only to create a new and unprecedented resource that we would share with our readers for their own searches, but also to identify companies that we would investigate in depth. The insurance piece drew on a national analysis we had done of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the trauma and resilience piece would be based in part on information and resources I had gained access to through my membership and participation in the and\nWe also sought to publish blog posts, videos, maps, court documents and others throughout the project, rather than wait until the end, and to forge collaborative relationships with other news publications.\nFinally, we wanted to look at these issues from a community-wide, rather than individual, perspective.\nOur project did not turn our precisely as we had planned.\nWe did indeed acquire the data mentioned above from OSHA and the EPA, and did blend this data with other data sources to which we had gained access. However, despite spending a lot of time on this effort, our enforcement story did not come from this route.\nInstead, we followed editor suggestion and of Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa. In August 2010 the company was the subject of the largest egg recall in United States history. We and found that Jack DeCoster, the company owner, had a more than of e, a substantial portion of which involved his conscious policy of hiring undocumented Mexican workers for their work ethic and vulnerability. In addition to finding a staggering lack of communication between federal agencies, we also we were able to raise the question if these workers were the proverbial “canary in the coal mine.” The implication was that more attention to undocumented workers’ conditions and safety could perhaps have averted the later consumer disaster and recall.\nWe also used the occasion of a seeming enforcement success, the closure of a notoriously filthy and dangerous migrant worker camp in Rantoul, Illinois due to a collective effort from largely local enforcement agencies, advocates, service providers and media. that while the closure of Cherry Orchard was indeed an accomplishment and even a model for other communities, it did very little to change in any fundamental way the experience of those migrant workers.\nThe insurance story was a bit more straightforward.\nHere we learned and the many creative ways full-time workers use to meet their health care needs and other pressing financial responsibilities like the rent and food. For example, we met a woman who had to choose one night between eating and buying medicine for a sick child.\nShe bought the medicine.\nFor the trauma and resilience story, we traveled to Beardstown, Illinois, which in 2007 was the site of a massive immigration raid at the Cargill plant. We thought Beardstown made sense because the raid was a universally shared and searing event that still was very much alive in the hearts and heads of the town’s Latino community. From that story we connected with Julio Flores, an El Salvadoran community activist who had to flee his country, but who had worked diligently in the town for 15 years to develop its sense of strength through cultural celebrations. y gave us new insight into communal trauma and the ways in which one can heal from it.\nWe did indeed publish as we went , and . We published mostly in Spanish, but had seven posts in English, too. Althoguh we reached out to a number of possible collaborators. We did not succeed in getting other outlets to use the data we provided to them as the basis for their stories. But the project did help us forge a deeper relationship with , a non-profit outfit at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with whom we are doing a project that will build on this reporting. It also gave us the material necessary to and give us the material to connect with ProPublica about working with them.\nWe also used for the first time to annotate the story about Wright County Egg.\nFinally, we published online line stories in the week before we came out with an eight-page print supplement that had the four major stories delineated above as well as profiles of people we met through the course of our reporting whose experiences resonated with the theme and content of the story with which it was paired.\nWe did not reach the moon and are still hearing from the community members about the work, but we did do a number of things we had never done before.\nWe did gain valuable information about the experiences of Latino individuals and communities in the Midwest.\nAnd we were able to paint a collective portrait of a richly diverse community many of whose members are struggling within significant constraints both to live a dignified life and to meet their families’ often pressing health care needs.\nWe will continue to explore these critical issues and are grateful for the opportunity granted to use through the fellowship and our participation in the ReportingonHealth community.\nTips for Other Reporters:\n- Sharpen the point, but be open to the twists and turns in the road.\n- Comb data and don’t get lost in the “rabbit hole” of data analysis. Try to remember the bigger picture.\n- Link individuals’ stories to policy and, if possible, to evidence that warnings have been given about the issue at hand.\n- Think of the stories on their own and as part of a greater whole.\n- Don’t forget the people. They are who it’s about and they are who the readers want to learn from in the project.\n- Don’t be afraid of reaching far, and remember to keep your feet on the ground.\nquestion:What were the main health issues faced by the Midwestern Latino communities according to the Hunt Fellowship proposal?"]}

While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.\nThe offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league. Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.\nMany of the biggest tradable players of the offseason—like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler—have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.\nCarmelo Trade Still a Possibility\nCarmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market. He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.\nThe fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.\nHowever, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold. The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers—the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.\nAnthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.\nWhile Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen. In fact, per Wojnarowski, Anthony is counting on the Knicks to resume talks him, league sources said.\"\nThe one thing the Knicks may be able to rely on is the fact Anthony previously expressed his desire to remain in New York in order to be close to his son. It's not as if the team can sell him on championship aspirations. The team can, however, try selling him on a playing environment.\nTrail Blazers, McCollum Getting in on the Carmelo Chase\nThe Cavaliers and the Rockets are the two teams Anthony has expressed interest in joining this offseason. However, that hasn't stopped other teams—or individual players—from trying to recruit Anthony.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers had previously been linked to Anthony as part of a three-team deal involving New York and Houston. However, Wojnarowski recently reported that Portland would instead prefer to land Anthony:\n.\"\nPortland squeaked into the playoffs last season with a .500 record, so it might be presumptuous for the team to believe it can compete with the likes of the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference just be adding Anthony. However, it the Trail Blazers do feel they can be title contenders with Anthony, it would make zero sense to facilitate his trade to Houston.\nTrail Blazers shooting guard C.J. McCollum got in on the recruiting action—and had a little bit of fun—over the weekend. He posted a Photoshopped picture of Anthony wearing a Portland uniform on his Instagram account, tagging Anthony in the photo.\nWhile McCollum's post isn't likely to sway Anthony too much, it might be a reminder that some teams want him—after the Knicks spend a large part of the offseason acting like they don't.\nKnicks Looking to Add a Point Guard\nWhile the Knicks may ultimately trade away Anthony, they're also reportedly looking to acquire talent. According to Ian Begley of ESPN, New York is looking to add a point guard. Per Begley, Brandon Knight of the Phoenix Suns has come up in trade discussions, both as an addition and as part of a Carmelo deal:\n.\"\nKnight averaged 11.0 points, 2.4 assists and 2.2 rebounds per game last season. He would presumably be a short-term option as New York develops rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina.\nMarc Berman of the New York Post reported last week that the Knicks had inquired about both Bledsoe and free agent Ramon Sessions.\nSessions would likely be a last-ditch value option for the Knicks, assuming the team is looking for a starting point guard. The 31-year-old averaged just 16.2 minutes and 6.2 points per game last season. Knight and Bledsoe—who averaged 21.1 points and 6.3 assists last season—would appear to be better primary options.\nquestion:Who are the two teams Carmelo Anthony is interested in joining via trade?"]}

Muscled up, often steroid-filled, testosterone-raging men who travel the globe on a regular basis can get a little grumpy from time-to-time. At times, these guys can lose their cool and get into altercations with each other. In part two of a new editorial series here at eWrestlingNews.com, “Backstage Fight Stories,” we’re going to take a look at another infamous behind-the-scenes brawl that involved two well-known professional wrestlers.\nAs I get older and the business continues to move ahead, I’m learning more and more that the fan base is filled with a lot of younger fans. I’m learning that stories I’ve heard, that I assume are common-knowledge to all wrestling fans, are actually brand new to this generation. So while you and I may remember these stories as if they happened yesterday, we have to understand that thousands upon thousands of younger fans have never heard of them. If you have, then enjoy reading about them again. If you haven’t, strap on your seat belts because some of them will shock the hell out of you. Today, in part two of our “Backstage Fight Stories” series, we will take a look at Scott Steiner vs. Diamond Dallas Page.\nScott Carl Rechsteiner, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Scott Steiner, was a legitimate amateur wrestler before entering the “professional” level. Rechsteiner wrestled at 190 pounds for the University of Michigan, where he became a three-time Big 10 runner-up after finishing fifth in his freshman year in college. He later became a NCAA Division I All-American and placed sixth in the United States in his senior year.\nPage Joseph Falkinburg, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Diamond Dallas Page (DDP), was originally an aspiring basketball player. Fulkinburg played basketball at St. Joseph’s High School (which is now known as Monsignor Donovan High School) during his freshman year on the junior varsity team, and on the varsity squad as a sophomore. Falkinburg later became a mainstay in the nightclub industry before becoming a full-fledged pro wrestler at an older age than most talents who enter the business.\nSteiner and Page both worked in WCW during the heyday of the infamous WWE vs. WCW “Monday Night Wars.” Things between the two reached a boiling point in 2001 when Kimberly Page, DDP’s wife at the time, found an illegal substance backstage and allegedly went to WCW management, informing them that it belonged to Tammy “Sunny” Sytch. Sytch denied the accusation and even offered to take a drug test on the spot — which she ended up passing. This is where things got interesting.\nApparently Steiner caught wind of what was happening and literally chased Kimberly out of the building. Subsequently, Kimberly would never appear on WCW television again.\nAt the following television taping, Steiner cut a shoot promo on Page, who at this point was fed up and felt the need to stand up for not only his wife, but himself as a man. Page ended up waiting for Steiner backstage after he cut the aforementioned televised promo, and this is where all hell broke loose.\nAs the story goes, DDP, who was waiting for Steiner behind the curtain, confronted the former NCAA Division I All-American wrestler as soon as he made his way backstage. The two allegedly exchanged some heated verbal insults before things got physical. Apparently the two ended up in a clinch, and depending on multiple versions of the story, DDP put a front-face-lock of sorts, or a guillotine choke by today’s mixed-martial-arts standards, on the larger grappler. The two were supposedly separated, but unfortunately for DDP the situation didn’t end there.\nAgain, there are a number of variations to the story, but apparently Steiner broke free from those holding him back at the time and allegedly went completely berserk. Page, who tried throwing a kick at Steiner, ended up on the ground as the result of a double-leg-dive, or a traditional amateur-style takedown from the man with the legitimate wrestling experience. Here’s where things got ugly, and where details become a bit scarce.\nSteiner reportedly went for DDP’s eyes. That’s right, Steiner tried ripping DDP’s eyeballs out of the socket, rendering the “People’s Champion” at the time (Page was calling himself that before “The Rock” was in WWE) blind. Going for the eyes in a legitimate fight is one of many tricks professional wrestlers were taught in the old days when instructed how to really “handle yourself” in a legitimate altercation. “The eyes are the groin of the face,” as was once referenced as a joke on the hit-comedy television series “The Office.”\nWhile it may have served as a joke for the documentary-style television series, truer words have never been spoken. Anyone who has taken a solid shot to the ball-bag knows — game over. At least temporarily. In this case, where several other muscled up bad asses were there to break things up, the game was over for good. DDP allegedly bit Steiner in an attempt to get “The Big Bad Booty Daddy” off of him, and the two were once again separated.\nDDP, who had come off as a hero to his fellow WCW employees for standing up to someone who was perceived as a bully, and during the initial scuffle reportedly looked to be holding his own in an impressive fashion, was a mess. His face was apparently in bad shape, with obvious damage suffered during their brief exchanges. Page later claimed that his face resembled “Freddy Krueger” from the popular horror movie series, “A Nightmare On Elm Street.”\nFor those who would like to hear Diamond Dallas Page tell his version of the story, click here to listen to an excerpt from a radio interview where he spends about five minutes discussing the legitimate backstage fight with Steiner.\nSo there you have it. Join us next time where we will take a look at another real-life fight in the not-so-real world of professional wrestling. Until next time, this has been another installment of the eWrestlingNews.com ongoing series, “Backstage Fight Stories.”\nFor those who missed it, click here to check out the first installment of “Backstage Fight Stories,” which features the story of the legitimate fight between Sid Vicious and Arn Anderson, where both guys ended up in the emergency room after being stabbed with a pair of scissors..\nquestion:Who were the two professional wrestlers involved in the backstage brawl discussed in part two of the \"Backstage Fight Stories\" series?"]}

At the outset of the pandemic, government agencies and health authorities scrambled to inform people on how to identify symptoms of the virus.\nBut as the virus has evolved, it seems the most common symptoms have changed too.\nEmerging data suggest people infected with the Delta variant - the variant behind most of Australia's current cases and highly prevalent around the world - are experiencing symptoms different to those we commonly associated with COVID earlier in the pandemic.\nWe're all different\nHumans are dynamic. With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways.\nA sign is something that's seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that's felt, like a sore throat.\nThe way a virus causes illness is dependent on two key factors:\nviral factors include things like speed of replication, modes of transmission, and so on. Viral factors change as the virus evolves.\nhost factors are specific to the individual. Age, gender, medications, diet, exercise, health and stress can all affect host factors.\nSo when we talk about the signs and symptoms of a virus, we're referring to what is most common. To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases.\nIt's important to note this data is not always easy to collect or analyze to ensure there's no bias. For example, older people may have different symptoms to younger people, and collecting data from patients in a hospital may be different to patients at a GP clinic.\nSo what are the common signs and symptoms of the Delta variant?\nUsing a self-reporting system through a mobile app, data from the United Kingdom suggest the most common COVID symptoms may have changed from those we traditionally associated with the virus.\nThe reports don't take into account which COVID variant participants are infected with. But given Delta is predominating in the UK at present, it's a safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant.\n(The Conversation/CC BY ND)\nWhile fever and cough have always been common COVID symptoms, and headache and sore throat have traditionally presented for some people, a runny nose was rarely reported in earlier data. Meanwhile, loss of smell, which was originally quite common, now ranks ninth.\nThere are a few reasons we could be seeing the symptoms evolving in this way. It may be because data were originally coming mainly from patients presenting to hospital who were therefore likely to be sicker. And given the higher rates of vaccination coverage in older age groups, younger people are now accounting for a greater proportion of COVID cases, and they tend to experience milder symptoms.\nIt could also be because of the evolution of the virus, and the different characteristics (viral factors) of the Delta variant. But why exactly symptoms could be changing remains uncertain.\nWhile we still have more to learn about the Delta variant, this emerging data is important because it shows us that what we might think of as just a mild winter cold - a runny nose and a sore throat - could be a case of COVID-19.\nThis data highlight the power of public science. At the same time, we need to remember the results haven't yet been fully analysed or stratified. That is, \"host factors\" such as age, gender, other illnesses, medications and so on haven't been accounted for, as they would in a rigorous clinical trial.\nAnd as is the case with all self-reported data, we have to acknowledge there may be some flaws in the results.\nDoes vaccination affect the symptoms?\nAlthough new viral variants can compromise the effectiveness of vaccines, for Delta, the vaccines available in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) still appear to offer good protection against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.\nImportantly, both vaccines have been shown to offer greater than 90 percent protection from severe disease requiring hospital treatment.\nA recent \"superspreader\" event in New South Wales highlighted the importance of vaccination. Of 30 people who attended this birthday party, reports indicated none of the 24 people who became infected with the Delta variant had been vaccinated. The six vaccinated people at the party did not contract COVID-19.\nIn some cases infection may still possible after vaccination, but it's highly likely the viral load will be lower and symptoms much milder than they would without vaccination.\nWe all have a role to play\nEvidence indicating Delta is more infectious compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of the virus is building.\nIt's important to understand the environment is also changing. People have become more complacent with social distancing, seasons change, vaccination rates vary - all these factors affect the data.\nBut scientists are becoming more confident the Delta variant represents a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain.\nAs we face another COVID battle in Australia we're reminded the war against COVID is not over and we all have a role to play. Get tested if you have any symptoms, even if it's \"just a sniffle\". Get vaccinated as soon as you can and follow public health advice.\nLara Herrero, Research Leader in Virology and Infectious Disease, Griffith University.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

I don’t want Cristiano getting a red card. I got convinced, or told at least it was fine.”\n/>\nLiverpool humiliate Man United.\nWhile Ronaldo was spared a long walk down the Old Trafford tunnel, teammate Paul Pogba wasn’t so lucky. The Frenchman received his marching orders just 15 minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute for a horror challenge on Naby Keita, which led to the Guinea international being stretchered off.\nRemarkably, Man United managed to play with 10 men for 30 minutes without conceding a goal but the damage had already been done thanks to those four first half strikes and a Mohamed Salah goal early in the second half which sealed his hat-trick.\n/>\nJurgen Klopp has Reds purring.\nMuch of the post-match focus has been on the miserable situation at Man United but Premier League rivals should take note of the form of Liverpool.\nThe Reds have won their last two Premier League matches 5-0 and have yet to taste defeat in the competition this season.

Deval Patrick signed the measure on Aug. 12 that provides funding for water infrastructure improvements in the state. Phelan was one of the supporters of the bill who spoke during the legislative debate on it at the State House earlier this year.\n\"The language in it (bill) gives us the potential to receive a grant from the state,\" Phelan said.\nPhelan explained that an amendment supported by Holbrook's legislators, Rep. Mark Cusack, Sen. Brian Joyce, and Sen. John Keenan would give the town an edge in either joining the MWRA or staying with Tri-Town and paying a share of building a new treatment plant in Randolph that would replace the existing aging facility.\nThe town has been negotiating with both the Tri-Town Water Board and the MWRA in trying to find the best cost-effective water distribution source.\nSelectmen approved to send a letter of interest to the MWRA formally notifying the authority that Holbrook is interested in negotiating joining the state system.\nPhelan said that the MWRA is aware of Holbrook's situation with Tri-Town and the legislation that provides an incentive to build a new treatment plant. He added that the MWRA is interested in negotiating with the Holbrook.\n\"They are anxious to provide water to us,\" he said.\nThe sticking point to joining the MWRA is the tie-in fee and necessary infrastructure upgrades that would cost Holbrook several million dollars, according to officials.\nPhelan said the new legislation that would match Holbrook's cost of building a new treatment plant or regional water system tie-in fee could give the town an edge with the MWRA.\n\"We could say (to the MWRA) absorb the costs of the infrastructure and entrance fee and we will buy water from you,\" he said. \"We will approach the MWRA one last time (with the proposal).\"\nTri-Town wants to build a new plant to replace the antiquated Randolph facility.\nHolbrook has balked at paying one-third of the construction cost, an agreement that goes back more than 100 years where Randolph, Braintree, and Holbrook each share equally all associated costs of the water distribution system.\nHolbrook officials have argued that the cost should be based on usage. Phelan noted that Holbrook uses the least amount of water.\nPhelan said that he recently got initial approval from Tri-Town that Holbrook would pay 15 percent of the plant's construction cost and 11 percent of operational costs thereafter.\nPage 2 of 2 - \"It was a compromise,\" Phelan said.\nHe also noted that under the Holbrook-Randolph Joint Water Board agreement, Holbrook pays half the costs.\n\"We've been subsidizing production of water for Randolph for over 100 years,\" Phelan said. \"We pay 50 percent of the cost when we utilize 25 percent of the water.\"\nHe noted that Holbrook has been negotiating for a long while with both Tri-Town and the MWRA.\n\"The delay (in making a decision) will ultimately benefit us,\" Phelan said.\nHe noted that the Legislature just approved the SouthField bill in Weymouth that allows the development at the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station to tie into the MWRA. Phelan said Holbrook, Randolph, and Braintree could be compensated from this should the water line run through the three towns.\nPhelan said that negotiations are to continue with both the MWRA and Tri-Town and expects a resolution soon.\n\"It's the MWRA or the plant,\" Phelan said. \"It's an issue that would affect our residents for years and years to come.\"\nquestion:What is the new legislation about that could give Holbrook an advantage in deciding a new water distribution source?"]}

I have sensitive skin, and it was causing my face to break out. I am phasing it out of my shower because it leaves large chunks of gooey-sand that dry and stick to the tub. I never seem to notice them when I’m showering, but whenever my daughters take a bath or I’m cleaning the bathtub, I really notice how much this product builds up in the tubs basin and on the ledges.\n2. Aveno’s Simply Radiant\nThis product is amazing. It smells wonderful, leaves my face glowing, soft, and best of all feeling healthy. I usually apply this after my facial cleanse (#3). My face has never felt better!\n3. Nuetrogena’s Stress Releif Acne Scrub\nI have very sensitive skin and it’s been hard to find a cleanser that actually gets the job done. When things get really stressful my face tends to break out, and this scrub has been remarkable. It has stopped the breakouts and cleared up any spots of acne that have already appeared. I follow it up with a skin toner (#2).\n4. Up&Up’s Soy Shave gel\nThis product is found exclusively at Target. You’ll hear me talk about the Up&Up brand a lot because I’m a big fan of it. They are low cost good quality products. This particular product leaves my skin smooth with a nice natural scent to follow.\n5. Yardly’s Mango Shower Gel\nI give this a thumbs down because while it does smell great, I am phasing it out of my shower. It doesn’t really leave a fresh feeling or fragrance behind, but rather lathers and disappears completely leaving the experience completely unmemorable. I’m still scouting for that perfect body wash that leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good!\n6. Garnier Fructis’s Sleek and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner\nI have used this product for years. It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling healthy and strong, and best of all it doesn’t give you that waxy buildup that other products do but does give you all the shine!\n7. Massagers\nThis are a good add to any shower, especially after a long day. Warm water and something to work out the kinks in your lower back and shoulders is just what the doctor ordered! Can usually find these in your bath isle at your local retail chains.\n8. Exfoliating Glove\nThese are wonderful to use for your feet, elbows, knees, and any other place you get dry skin. I usually apply some body wash and work it into a lather using this glove. Goodbye dead skin, hello good feelings!\n9. Munckin tub cup\nThis handy tub-cup is made of a very flexible rubber. This is super helpful for when you need to rinse out the shampoo from your kids hair (press the cup to their forehead and it bends to ensure water will not get into their eyes). I store mine upside down from my shower caddy to ensure it dries and does not collect mildew and standing water.\n10. Crayola color-changing loufas\nThis is a very fun way to get your kids excited about lathering away their dirty day. These loufas change color when they heat up (from pink to white). It’s fun to put a little magic into bath-time.\nquestion:Why is the user phasing out the Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub from their shower routine?"]}
{"question_id": 80, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\n[Jenial Thanks to Janine Mendes-Franco, of Global Voices Online, for selecting two posts, about Our rising emigration and the changes in Our inner voice.]\nWhat kind of voter movement would make the biggest difference in Our deteriorating PanoRama?\nFirst, what would a voter movement be and is one needed? Taking the last question first: crime up, murders way up, education dropping even more than its Third World rating would predict, corruption up, jobs down, economy tanking, government bond debt limit reached, government credit rating dropping, stupid political leaders playing kissie-assie with each other, emigration rising... If anyone thinks the current sewage dump of \"\"\"leaders\"\"\" is going to change their thieving, me-first bullshit, then they are retarded and should not vote.\nAs for why a voter movement and not some other \"peaceful\" process: short of a violent overthrow and non-existent recall solutions, the simplest and most direct path to change Our (non)government is through the elections. Since every electoral office is up for grabs every 4 years, the only real chance We have to make minimal or wholesale changes is at the ballot box.\nMoving on. The voter movement I envision would obviously have to cross party lines, galvanize abut 350,000 - 425,000 votes and focus on taking out entrenched Fools.\nWhy?\n1) Cross party lines: The average voter wants to feel that his or her vote \"wins\" in some way. Appealing to only one party or ideology group will cause the average voter (species name: Voticus ignoramus) to fear that their vote will \"be wasted.\" Of course, they don't see that voting for anyone already elected is \"wasting\" their vote because those already in power are parasites living off Our indifference.\n2) Galvanize 350,000-425,000 voters: The average election in Puerto Rico has about an 85% turnout and that means about 1.8 million votes cast. Twenty percent of that number is 360,000, a substantial number that will cause all Fools to take the voter movement extremely seriously. Especially when the movement focuses on point 3...\n3) Taking out entrenched Fools: There are folks in Our government that have the morals of an opium fiend with the willies, the ethical standards of a child-molesting priest and the intellectual development of week-old gumbo. Yet these scumbuckets are making decisions about Our economy (crashing), Our education (crashed), Our taxes (crushing) and thus Our future (crushed.) For that privilege, We are paying many of them salary and benefit packages that are simply ridiculous when compared to Our averages: mayors making over $100,000 a year, legislators making over $110,000, Cabinet officials over $190,000 and even support staff is making over $80,000. And what about consultants making over $125,000 on each of two or three \"legitimate\" contracts?\nBy attacking the incumbents, the voter movement automatically becomes one \"of change, for change.\" Rather than attack all the incumbents, a series of targets are selected, primarily from the legislature. (Folks, I don't capitalize words for institutions I don't have at least a modicum of respect.) To make the biggest change, targets from each major party are selected and the criteria are simple: Those holding key legislative positions (president, vicepresident, speaker of each chamber, etc.) and those with the longest incumbencies (long-term parasites.)\nA quick scan means that media tumors and crap merchants like Jenniffer \"Gluttonny\" González and Tomás \"Mad Dog\" Rivera would be targeted alongside commonwealth party tapeworms like Antonio \"You Haven't Caught Me\" Fas and José \"I Look Up to Tapeworms\" Varela. As the statehood party currently controls the legislature, there will be more names from that party than from the other, but that's how these changes work: by targeting those who have the most to lose.\nIn that sense, all legislators elected \"by accumulation,\" i.e., not tied to any senatorial or representational district, are the best targets, for they are often \"\"\"party leaders\"\"\" who use their \"\"widespread mandate\"\"\" to fuck Us. (Notice the absolute lack of quotation marks around fuck Us. Twice.)\nAlso amongst the targets are certain mayors, who have become entrenched to the point of idiocy. Two examples are Carlos \"I'm A Businessman Like the Mafia Is a Brotherhood\" Méndez, of Aguadilla and José \"City Hall Is My Closet\" Rodríguez, of Mayagüez. Why them? because they've been in that chair for over 12 years; their time is past, if it ever was.\nThe voter movement would focus on kicking out incumbents, targeting them with direct questions, deep analysis of their shortcomings and raising awareness of how utterly useless these high-profile, long-squatting pisspots are. Rather than trying to change the entire political system, the voter movement would narrow its focus to a true leverage position: shaking the foundation of the most ambitious and entrenched.\nNothing strikes more fear into the heart of a Fool--more so than an F.B.I. badge--than a voter group that the Fool cannot buy. A voter movement aimed at knocking off incumbents, that crosses party lines in order to make changes happen, is a powerful force: when that force is applied well, it makes change inevitable.\nAnd once the voter movement proves its worth, it need only target other high-profile, long-squatting smegmacups to make them pay attention to Us. Because that's the whole point of this voter movement: to make the Fools understand that they work for Us and that We hold the power, not them.\nA name? Okay, how about Junta Electoral Nacional Independiente Organizada: JENIO.\nYeah, I know that's \"Jenius\" in Spanish, but it does have a certain ring to it, dissonant yet affecting.\nHowever, for populist appeal, We could go with Movimiento Pa' Fuera, the Get Out Movement.\nI know, Brethren: the trilling rhythms of \"¡Pa' fuera, pa' la calle!\" are already ringing in your ears...\nThe Jenius Has Spoken.\n2 comments:\nMake it happen! ;)\nI'm looking into it, Joe...\nquestion:What is the main goal of the voter movement as envisioned in the context?"]}
{"question_id": 81, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nJeff Larson defends use of RNC funds [INTERVIEW]\nBy Andy Mannix and Mike Mullen\nIn 2008, St. Paul hosted the Republican National Convention. Republican strategist Jeff Larson was the CEO and treasurer of the host committee, which raised $65 million prior to the four-day event (Read this week's feature, RNC Piggy Bank). After the convention left town and its debts were paid, the host committee still had a surplus of more than $7 million.\nThough the bulk would go to charity, a number of individuals and companies continued to receive payments from the surplus years after the convention. Several campaign finance experts who analyzed the expenditure reports for City Pages say the pattern of spending so long after the convention is abnormal, and deserves an explanation.\nFor this we went to Larson, the man in charge. Larson declined to be interviewed over the phone, but agreed to answer questions via e-mail. Larson did not respond to questions about payments made to specific individuals after the convention. Here's an abbreviated version of what he would tell us:\nCity Pages: Can you start by explaining who selected you to be CEO of the 2008 Republican National Convention Host Committee? Why were you interested in taking this job?\nJeff Larson: I believed the Twin Cities needed a shot in the arm. It had been a long time since the Minneapolis St Paul had hosted anything nearly as large as the National Convention. You would have to go back to the Super Bowl in 1991 since we were on the national stage...\n...Since it was the Republican Convention that decided to come here, and since the Host Committee needed someone who knew the community and knew the workings of the RNC, they asked me to take this position. I did it to help ensure Minneapolis Saint Paul put on a world-class Convention that put us on the map with other convention cities like Chicago, Boston, New York, New Orleans, Denver and Los Angeles. We did exactly that thanks to our Board, our team, and the community.\nCP: It's been more than two years now since the convention, and the host committee still exists. Why has the committee not closed yet?\nJL: The short answer is the Federal Elections Commission had not allowed us to do so\nCP: You told National Journal reporter Ed Pound in 2008 that your position as CEO of the committee was unpaid. Why?\nJL: I was brought on as the Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee on July 1, 2007. According to the written Consulting Agreement, I could be reimbursed for expenses but draw no consulting fee or payment. I was eligible for a discretionary bonus at the conclusion of the convention based on the Board's view of how well I achieved certain goals and if there was any money left over.\nOn July 21, 2009, the Board of Directors held an Executive Session to discuss my performance as Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee. At that time, I had served as the CEO for over 2 years. The Board voted to pay me $400,000 for this work.\nSponsor Content\nquestion:Who was the CEO and treasurer of the host committee for the 2008 Republican National Convention?"]}

We have more than 40 years of combined experience advising home owners and employees. We provide our clients with the personalized representation they need to assert their rights and protect their interests.\nA job-related accident or illness can leave you disabled and unable to financially support your family and yourself. Massachusetts, however, provides a way for injured workers to receive certain benefits if they are hurt in the course of their employment. Under the state Workers’ Compensation Act, all employers in the state must carry this no-fault insurance coverage. It provides medical, wage, job retraining, and other benefits to employees who were harmed or became sick as a result of their work.\nTo qualify for workers’ compensation benefits, your injury or illness must be job-related and cause you to miss at least five days of work. Your employer’s insurer will review your claim to determine your eligibility. If you qualify, you will receive compensation for reasonable and necessary medical costs associated with your injuries, partial wage compensation, and possibly other benefits.\nThe amount of financial assistance you receive, and the duration, will depend on how much your accident or illness disabled you. The main categories are:\nYour employer’s insurer may try to deny your claim for a number of reasons. For instance, it may dispute your eligibility, the extent of your injury or illness, or your need for certain medical care. It may also approve your claim and then later ask the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) to reduce your benefits. If the insurer denies or wants to modify your benefits, you can dispute the decision by appealing to the DIA. The dispute process involves various stages, including a meeting with a DIA conciliator and hearings before an administrative judge. You will need to present medical evidence to support your position. Our attorneys have handled numerous workers’ compensation claims. We can advise and represent you if your claim has been denied or if the insurer wants to modify your benefits.\nAt Pulgini & Norton, we advise home owners, buyers, sellers, and lenders in a broad range of real estate matters.

Abstinence means the avoidance of certain types of food.\nThese guidelines are from the United States Council of Catholic Bishops:\nAsh Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory days of fasting and abstinence.\nFridays during Lent are obligatory days of abstinence for those age 14 and up. Church law specifies abstaining from eating meat, such as poultry, beef, lamb or pork, as an act of penitence.\nFasting is obligatory from age 18 until age 59. When fasting, a person is permitted to eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal.\nIn all cases, common sense should prevail, and people who are ill should not further jeopardize their health by fasting. Those that are excused from fast and abstinence (outside the age limits) include the physically or mentally ill, individuals suffering from a chronic illness, and pregnant or nursing women.\nquestion:What are the guidelines for fasting and abstinence according to the United States Council of Catholic Bishops?"]}

Thump3rDX17 (Posts: 2160; Member since: 10 May 2010)\nwhat excuse has Motorola made? they let everyone know they were interested in unlocking the bootloaders and later on told us when they were going to make it happen, that's JUST what HTC has done, they're even matching Motorola's time table for the unlocking process. your criticisms towards Motorola about how they're handling the situation are now completely void. it's irrefutable Miz.\n9. SuperAndroidEvo (Posts: 4620; Member since: 15 Apr 2011)\nI have to agree with Thump3rDX17. Motorola WILL unlock their bootloaders. HTC is showing some great support for their phones. I have had my HTC Evo 3D since June 24th & by late August they will unlock the bootloader, that is fantastic! It shows the commitment HTC has to its fan base & the commitment it has for the developer circle also. Motorola will follow in the same footsteps. Motorola would NEVER soil their relationship with their fan base. It’s only a matter of time!\n11. The_Miz (Posts: 1496; Member since: 06 Apr 2011)\nNothing is void as Motorola are dragging their asses with the announcement. Oh and why not just make good on their promise and release the Droid 3 without locking the bootloader? Because without the unlocked bootloader, the Droid 3 is a subpar phone even though unlocking it won't change that.\nYou won't be able to rid if of the horrible Verizon bloat or change the launcher from that godawful motorblur.\nI am telling it like it is - Motorola are making excuses.\n12.

This formula is crafted with Tri-Hyal technology, a ground-breaking anti-aging concept that combines 3 types of cross-linked hyaluronic acid for ultimate correction.\nYou can order Filorga Art Filler Volume at wholesale prices from Doctormedica online. You can also call, fax, or email us to place an order today. For detailed information on our ordering and shipping processes, visit our website.\nEach box of Filorga Art Filler Volume contains 2 pre-filled syringes, 4-25G1” sterile single-use needles, a package insert, and 4 traceability labels.\nThe unique texture of this dermal filler enables it to effectively volumize, hydrate, and contour facial skin, eliminating fine lines for a smooth, beautifully sculpted look. Its specialized form of hyaluronic acid ensures that it improves both the appearance and the quality of treated skin, leaving patients with incredible, long-lasting results. It has also been proven to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, increasing overall skin health.\nThis formula contains Tri-hyal hyaluronic acid, giving it added smoothing potential. This solution also contains about 0.3% licodaine, a local anesthetic.\nFilorga Art Filler Volume is made of 3 different forms of hyaluronic acid, each of which has a unique molecular weight. This allows it to steadily and evenly volumize the skin, as well as effectively sculpt and contour the face.\nHyaluronic acid occurs naturally in the body, where it nourishes skin by helping it to retain moisture. However, throughout the aging process, this natural supply is depleted. This causes the skin to become dry, wrinkled, and sallow. Luckily, by injecting hyaluronic acid back into aging skin, Filorga Art Filler Volume plumps and hydrates at a cellular level, filling out the facial features.\nOnly qualified medical professionals may perform this treatment. Prior to administration, disinfect the area to be treated and assemble the syringe following proper aseptic guidelines. Depending on the area to be treated, the proper injection technique and amount of filler to be used will vary based on practitioner preference. After injection, the treated region should be massaged to ensure uniform distribution of the product.\nEach treatment session with Filorga Art Filler Volume will take between 30 minutes and 1 hour to complete, depending on the severity of correction required.\nThis dermal filler can be used to increase facial volume and add density to skin, as well as for sculpting the facial features. Due to the hydrating properties of hyaluronic acid, it also moisturizes skin at the cellular level.\nFilorga Art Filler Volume with Lidocaine is ideal for use on the face.\nFilorgas Art Filler Volume has exceptional durability. At 9 months after the initial treatment, a top-up treatment should be administered to extend the implant’s life to 18 months. Please note that results may vary from patient to patient based on their age, health, and metabolism.\nBy ordering Art Filler Volume online directly from Doctormedica, you may take advantage of our wholesale prices to ensure that your patients get the results they desire—at the lowest possible price point. This dermal filler will rehydrate their skin, add natural-looking volume, and sculpt the face, leaving patients’ features looking not only plump and beautifully defined, but moisturized and healthy.\nThis filler is intended for patients who are experiencing noticeable signs of aging, with sagging and general volume loss occurring in their cheeks and other facial areas.\nCertain patients should not use this filler, despite its generally high safety profile. These include pregnant and breastfeeding women; individuals with autoimmune or bleeding disorders; patients with a hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this formulation; and patients who are prone to keloid scarring.\nAfter injection, many patients experience some mild swelling, bruising, redness, and irritation at the treatment site. However, these side effects rarely escalate, and genuinely disappear within days. In rare cases, patients may experience more serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity, granuloma formation, and skin necrosis. If these issues occur, immediate medical attention is required. To ensure your patients’ safety, please consult the included product leaflet for more information on potential complications, contraindications, and warnings associated with this treatment.\nReviews are written by customers who have made verified purchases of this product.

They were more than happy to wait a few years if that’s what it took to get everyone in one place. Sarah & Ale are the kind of people you just want to be around. The wedding took place in an open field overlooking the foothills of the Italian Alps. This part of Italy is made up of hundreds of tiny towns connected by winding mountain roads. It’s definitely Italy, but the German-Swiss influence can’t be missed. It’s a beautiful blend of cultures and an incredibly charming part of Italy. In true Italian form, there was a vintage vespa, free-flowing wine & limoncello, and once evening arrived, customary games played by the bride & groom. The couple went for a relaxed and vintage feel for their attire. Sarah and Ale also had a few lovely details made by family and friends to be enjoyed at the reception tucked away in the woods. We loved being a part of a real Italian wedding – it was such an incredible experience.” From Sarah and Ale Our initial idea was to have two wedding parties: one in Italy where Ale comes from and another in Brazil I am from but we were worried that would divide the family and the friends we have from all over the world because they would have to decide which one of the two parties to go. So we agreed that it would be best to have one single party and northern Italy was chosen. Ale’s family has a field with a breathtaking view that perfectly matched our vision for the kind of ceremony we wanted, a very relaxed, laid back and family oriented celebration on the mountains of Ale’s childhood. The reception took place in a wooden house in a forest close to the field and it was everything we were hoping for. We didn’t have a planner or any type of professionals involved (except for our photographers) and so everything was made with the help of friends and family and it couldn’t have been better. Italian weddings have a few unique traditions and we wanted to incorporate some of them into our own day. One of them is that the bride doesn’t walk down the aisle with her bouquet and instead the groom holds it and gives it to her when she gets to the top and we included this one in our own wedding day. Another tradition that we enjoyed was the one where the Italian friends prepare several games and pranks for the new wed couple. This was a lot of fun and relatively well behaved! We had friends and family coming from 12 different nationalities and it was priceless to see them all together in the one place. Everyone was so happy, enjoying the day with us. It was just amazing!

I love deviled eggs and egg salad, but I had never made pickled eggs. I first saw these in a buffet prepared by Tellico Kats Deli, where owners Kellye and Tomye shared how they had been eating these since growing up in Pennsylvania. This made more sense when I searched online for recipes and discovered that beet pickled eggs are an Amish dish. I've adapted my version from several recipes.\nThe recipe can easily be doubled, but my 'new' antique egg server has 12 slots, so I cooked 7 eggs… one for me to eat and the rest cut in halves to serve. I'll be sure to make these again when my chrysanthemum daisies with bright yellow centers and magenta petals are flowering, so I can decorate the platter with a matching floral arrangement in the center.\nPickled Eggs and Beets\n1 pint jar or 15 oz can of sliced beets (not pickled)\n7 hard-boiled eggs, peeled *\nwater\n1/2 c cider vinegar\n1 T honey\n1 T pickling spices\n1 stick of cinnamon\noptional: one small onion, thinly sliced\nDrain and reserve the juice from the beets into a large measuring cup, and add water to make 1 cup of liquid. Put the cooked whole eggs into a one-quart canning jar and top with the optional onions.\nPut the pickling spices into a tea ball, mesh sack, or other strainer. In a saucepan, add the beet juice mix, vinegar, cinnamon stick and pickling spice bag and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes and stir in the honey. Caution - this mixture will stain, as the finished eggs illustrate. Wipe up any spills with a disposable wipe, not your favorite dish cloth!\nPour the simmered liquid into the jar of eggs while hot (Tip: never pour very hot liquid into a cold jar or you'll risk breaking the jar - and having a dangerous hot liquid pouring out; if necessary, run hot water over the outside of the jar to warm it). Add the spice sack, then put the reserved beet slices on top. Allow to cool, then cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 5 days ahead, giving the eggs time to absorb the color and flavor. If the eggs are too tight against the side of the jar (and still look white), gently insert a narrow rubber spatula into the side of the jar, to maneuver the eggs and liquid around, for more even coloring.\nWhen ready to serve, remove the beets and onions with a slotted spoon, draining in a sieve. Discard the spices. Gently remove the eggs next, setting them on a paper towel in a flat dish so the liquid is absorbed. Discard the pickling liquid. Cut each egg in half, and arrange with the beets on a serving platter.\n* To hard-boil eggs: Set eggs in a saucepan and cover 1\" over with cold water. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, keeping covered, and leave for 10 minutes. Pour off the water and run under cold water over the eggs to cool them. Some say it helps to peel each egg under running water, and finding the thin white membrane right under the shell makes it peel off more easily, in bigger pieces.\nquestion:What is the main ingredient of the Amish dish that the author adapted their version from?"]}

Did you say Fudgemella?\n“Caught in a downward fiscal spiral, she began to toy with the idea of branching out, maybe learning a new skill, like Badger-baiting, or popery, which was all the rage.”\nHello? What are you talking about? What’s going on?\n“As she traipsed through the streets of the generic proto-germanic settlement, she swung her hips seductively, perhaps hoping for some kind of monetary reward. Her gods had done something right with those hips, so the scales appeared balanced. She considered going to Denmark where her super-power might be more useful”\nOh God, am I trapped in the consciousness of a bad writer? Wait, was that a Tycho Brahe reference?\n“As she passed a group of travelling diplomats (whose employer was in no way related to the events that surrounded Fudgemella’s eventual disappearance, rescue and vindication), she arched her brow, or her eyebrow – it is quite difficult to see from here.”\nI am trapped in the mind of a bad writer. Hang on, did you just give away the ending? And you’re referencing the writer’s perspective? Are you mad?\n“Quite by chance, a knightly knight by the name of Sir Deus arrived. ‘Madam,” he said unto her, forcing the words ‘twixt cup and manly lip, ‘I am Sir Deus. Deus X Machina. The X stands for, er, Ex. I am here to teach you the art of delusion.'”\nOh, come on! You’re saying that you actually have a character named –\n“Fudgemella, startled by the knight’s abrupt/surprising appearance, laughed with gentle admonishment. ‘Sir knight, I have no such need for your teaching, for I have already mastered that particular skill.’ She flicked a bead of sweat from her brow with the last two centimetres of a stiffened digit.\nIf I promise not to criticise will you let me leave? Please…no more…\n“The knight, pushed to a rage beyond compare – like that other fellow that got just as angry when someone broke his pencil – charged his mighty steed into the watching diplomats, piercing, quite by happenstance, their hearts with his lance, like a diplomatic kebab. Although that probably shouldn’t be a reference in a period piece. Unless kebabs existed in medieval Poland. Make it a – what do they have in Poland? Sausages? Yes, pierced their hearts like a mighty polish sausage.”\nNot sure about the imagery in this – very suspect…\n“Thus the dusky maiden’s refusal to bow down to masculine domination caused the world to explode into war that lasted eight years, with a hiatus in the middle when one of the knight’s friends got lost in a copse.

CBS sports has him ranked as the No. 6 overall prospect and the No. 1 free safety in this year's class. \"No disrespect to Jalen, but\".\n\"I think preparation leading up to this point has been the key thing with our offensive coaches helping us throughout the process\", Tagovailoa said.\nThe win gave Alabama its 17th national championship.\nThere will be many eyes on Alabama and MSU through the spring and into the summer months to see how Saban and Joe Moorhead handle their quarterbacks.\nPresident of Saint Louis School, Glen Medeiros, said \"The tradition here at Saint Louis School is one that has us believe that there's nothing that we can't overcome\".\nThe first obviously begins with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\nBefore even committing to the Crimson Tide, of course Tua wanted to go to OR to follow the path his big bro Mariota set for him.\nAndy Pappanastos is off the hook. The ensuing 40-yard attempt sailed wide left, leaving Alabama scoreless.\nSaban rolled the dice and came up a victor on Monday night and his decision to throw in his freshman Tua Tagovailoa into the mix worked out pretty well. \"He has unbelievable talent, unbelievable release and can get out of trouble as you saw\"'. But, the young sophomore was there for his team every step of the way to give Tagovailoa encouragement.\nFor Hurts, the cooling off period is a good thing. It's hard to imagine any situation mirroring the night vs. day dynamic of Hurts in the first half Monday and Tagovailoa in the second.\nIt wasn't just Tagovailoa and Smith.\nThe players stormed the field and in one play, Tagovailoa became a hero for life in the state of Alabama. His 80-yard touchdown pass for a 20-7 lead midway through the third quarter seemed like a dagger.\nMeanwhile, junior wide receiver Calvin Ridley has played in 43 games for Alabama, with 1 fumble that was recovered. Trailing by three and facing fourth-and-5 from the Dawgs 33 with 42 seconds to go, Sherrill called a timeout to discuss his team's options.\nBoth were against Texas in the 2009 title game, and both were by special teams, including an interception of a ball thrown by punter P.J. Fitzgerald. \"He provided them some juice, got them some momentum, got the momentum swung back their way\".\nTennessee will have to fight Alabama tooth and nail to land Tagovailoa. He drove the Tide into field goal range.\nOne play later, the Tide was national champions.\nThe freshman receiver originally committed to Georgia but de-commited after Mark Richt left the program.\n\"If you look at the Sugar Bowl, you could kind of see on the sidelines some coaches and players, knowing people in that building, they were pushing for Tua in the Sugar Bowl. Then we had another shot in overtime and we weren't able to do that\".\nFor one former SEC coach, the move to Tagovailoa came a bit later than if he were still the coach.\nSubscribe and download our College Gridiron 365 podcast on and.\nquestion:Who was the coach of Crimson Tide when they won their 17th national championship?"]}

{"question_id": 104, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nAre animal proteins better than vegetable ones? Let’s clarify this debate that often arises when it comes to defending or attacking the vegetarian and vegan lifestyle.\nProteins are polymers made up of the union of several “bricks” called amino acids. Among the three macronutrients, proteins are those whose structural role represents the primary function, while the energetic role is secondary, unlike carbohydrates and lipids. Proteins perform hundreds of different functions in the body and their intake with the diet must be constant, as the body does not have a real protein reserve, unlike lipids and carbohydrates.\nWhen it comes to proteins, two fundamental aspects must be considered: quantity and quality.\n- Quantity: the body can obtain the amino acids it needs either from the proteins we ingest with food or by degrading the proteins present in the body, such as those that make up muscles (mechanism that explains the reduction of muscle mass during low-calorie diets);\n- Quality: the body uses twenty different types of amino acids. Our body is able to synthesize only some of them while others, defined as “essential”, must be introduced exclusively with food.\nIt is therefore important to choose foods not only for the amount of protein they contain but also for their quality, so that it provides all the amino acids needed by the body.\nWhich is the best protein source: animal or vegetable? Leaving aside the ethical choice, the aspects to be analyzed are many and often cause confusion.\n- If we only consider the chemical aspect, the amino acids that make up animal and vegetable proteins are identical. The difference lies in the amino acid composition of the proteins. Those of vegetable origin are penalized by the fact that they do not provide all the essential amino acids, while animal protein sources are complete in their composition and for this reason they are defined as “proteins of high biological value”.\n- However, we must take into account that by eating any food we also ingest other nutrients. Red meat contains proteins of high biological value but also saturated fats and molecules that increase the risk of developing colon cancer, for example. If we ingest a plant-based food, we know that we do not bring all the essential amino acids but also fibers, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals that will have a protective effect, for example for colon cancer. So, no food has only positive aspects, but each food must be evaluated in its entirety.\n- Digestibility of proteins. It is not enough for the food to contain a certain amount of protein if the body is unable to digest them and absorb all the amino acids. Proteins of animal origin have a very high digestibility while those from cereals and legumes have a digestibility of 80-90% and the other vegetable sources about 50-80% compared to animal ones. This is why the nutritional recommendations indicate a daily protein intake increased by 10% in subjects who take exclusively vegetable proteins.\nTo conclude, the transition to a more ‘vegetable’ dietary model does not necessarily improve the nutritional adequacy of a diet. The closer you get to a vegetarian model, the more important it is to ensure a high variety of protein sources used. While, if you opt for an omnivorous diet, it is important to carefully choose animal foods in their entirety of nutrients and try to make at least half of the proteins from plant sources.\nquestion:What are the two fundamental aspects to consider when it comes to proteins?"]}

{"question_id": 107, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nH-EDS/JHS can be a debilitating, disabling and devastating disease for some patients. Some people can have a milder course. It is a spectrum and in my family, we are three people with this disease, but with different manifestations and degrees of severity.\nTaking care from the moment of diagnosis can change a child’s future. Consult a rheumatologist who understands how serious this condition can be in some individuals. Your child’s rheumatologist also should know that instead of waiting to see what kind of course it runs in your child, it is better you get the advice and consultation of a good physiotherapist right now as a preemptive and preventive strategy.\nPersonal Example of difficulties a child/ teenager might face:\nI had excruciating shoulder and back ache as a kid from carrying my school backpack. I had severe pain for days on after attending PE (or PT) classes on Saturdays. I had severe pain in my fingers and hand when trying to keep up with teachers writing on blackboard or dictating notes. I had severe pain in my legs in the evening making it difficult to do my homework. My school rickshaw did not turn up one day, and I walked 2 km back to home – and the leg pain lasted for days. As I grew up, I cycled 2 kilometers to school – precipitating severe leg pain and asthma everyday. I had recurrent urinary tract infections (including few episodes of cystitis) since I was ten. I was easily exhausted – fatigue is a problem in many JHS patients. I could not tolerate extreme temperatures, and low blood pressure has always been a problem. As a teenager, I started migraines. I got a subluxation of my jaw joint when I kept my mouth open too wide for too long during a dental procedure. I have recurrent gum problems in spite of good dental care since childhood. As a teenager, my wrists got severely and irreversibly damaged within a matter of two years after lifting water filled buckets daily. I have very poor proprioception (joint position sense) in my knee joints, and without looking in the mirror I have no idea if I am overextending or not. I consciously keep it microbent (flexed) a bit all the time – which has its own side effects, but it lowers the knee pain. I do forget some times, and it precipitates severe pain. I have to be mindful about my joints all the time. Small forgetful incidents where a joint is in a bad position or stressed for some time can lead to pain for weeks.\nYour child might face variations of such symptoms – believe him/her and get proper help. A person with JHS must not do impact sports or high velocity sports. You will need to talk to the teachers as well to ensure they get to do beneficial PE instead of something that leads to pain and damage. Proper fitting completely flat shoes with good cushioning inside as essential. They can damage their wrists by lifting weights like bags if it is done daily or frequently. Some JHS kids also have sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. They should stay active to stay strong, maintain stamina and avoid obesity. The child should avoid sitting in W position and doing funny tricks with weird joint contortions. They may have problems related to coordination, gait and balance that can affect their education and career choices.\nIt will help to consult a tertiary center of physiotherapy in some reputable hospital for your child to get help in these matters:\n- Gait training for walking and standing without overextending joints (like knees for example). They will need training for core stability, core strengthening and posture. They have to learn to be conscious of their posture and what is the right posture.\n- Know the specific exercises that will help them. They will indeed need to stay active and exercise daily.\n- Learn that they must not go to the full extent of the stretch in any exercise- they need to stop a few cm short of the full range. If they move their limbs to the full range of movement, most likely they will overextend their joints without knowing it.\n- They must not do the same activity for a long time. If they are writing, stop after half an hour, do some oral or other studies and then go back to writing. Same postures (of hands, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, feet, any part, any joint) for a long duration will go on damaging the ligaments.\n- When they start using computers, they will need to learn how to use them without damaging their wrists and getting spinal problems.\n- Swimming is considered beneficial.\nThe rheumatologist should inquire about and coordinate the management of other systemic (other than the musculoskeletal) manifestations the child has – dysautonomia, dyspraxia (coordination difficulties), eye problems, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory or allergy related problems, urinary problems, etc.\nSee these articles/websites to know more about the correct approach to managing kids with joint hypermobility syndrome:\nChildren’s guidelines from BritishSociety for Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology\nChildren with JHS advice sheet (excellent explanation)\nquestion:What are some of the precautions and strategies a child with JHS should follow to manage their condition?"]}

Because of this, food serves as both the attraction and the entertainment. The goal is to have food experiences worthy of sharing via online and in person.\nFood as Fuel. The fast-paced and over-committed lives of today's consumers have fueled visits to fast-casual and quick-service restaurants. Consumers also eat to provide themselves with energy to get through the day.\nLoving Local. Consumers are will to pay more for locally sourced food when dining out in their continued desire for local and sustainable food. However, consumers enjoy exploring new cultures through food, including exotic spices, unique ingredients and global cooking styles.\nHealthful, Yet Indulgent. Today's consumers expect meals to be both healthy and delicious when dining out. They are unwilling to trade taste for healthfulness, but they do prefer to limit certain ingredients vs. completely eliminating them. Despite the talk surrounding healthfulness, consumers also love restaurants that offer \"over-the-top\" menu items and believe that indulgent foods are worth the splurge.\nChildhood Nostalgia Meets Adult Sophistication. When dining out, consumers search for nostalgia and crave foods that remind them of their childhood. However, this doesn't change the fact that consumers also admire artistic food presentations, sophisticated flavor combinations and avant-garde cooking techniques.\nSimplicity and Transparency. Consumers like foods they can taste and ingredients they can understand. This means they desire fresh ingredients prepared with simple techniques and elegant presentations. Yet, consumers are also drawn to the simplicity of rustic, home-style foods and crave authentic flavor experiences.\n\"For any major trends identified, equally powerful counter trends appeared,\" explained Sharon Olson, executive director of Culinary Visions Panel. \"To describe this phenomenon, we've coined the term ‘OxyModern Food Trends.’ And we see it as a driving force behind tomorrow's menus.\"\nThe Culinary Visions Panel is a research and trend forecasting firm.

{"question_id": 112, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nWelcome to Church ... Kids Not Invited\nMike Thomas\nI was so distracted once at a church service (away from here), from an overwhelming amount of noise from the audience, that I had a hard time concentrating on the lesson. I tried focusing my attention on the speaker, but the person behind me and a few others across the isle were extremely loud—for what seemed to be every 30 seconds. The problem? You may think I am referring to rowdy kids or fussy children, with parents who would not take them out, but in fact I am referring to adults. The noise was coming from grown people during an adult Bible class! They had coughing attacks that made it difficult for them to sit quietly.\nWhat did I do as a member of the audience? Instead of giving them the “evil eye” or condemning them, I extended patience to them with the hope they would quiet down in a little bit. And, after a few minutes, their coughing subsided. I may have missed a few comments the speaker was making, until the coughing stopped, but I eventually picked up on the lesson and was able to benefit from the study.\nI recently learned of a church of Christ that does not permit small children in the auditorium during worship services. If the children want to accompany their parents to services, they must go to a daycare within the building during worship. While this might sound like a great solution to the “fuss” caused by small children, it reeks of foulness and self-centeredness to me. How can parents rear their children in the “training and admonition of the Lord” while leaving out one of the most essential aspects to godly living: worship? What kind of message does this send to the children regarding church services? To any honest observer it says, “If you bother me in church, I will have you removed.” There can be no other message sent!\nHow can the adults at that church teach the children about patience and longsuffering if they exclude children from worship for an occasional cry or whimper? I agree that excessively noisy kids should be removed—to a nursery or cry room to meet their needs. But that is a “horse of a different color” than not permitting them in worship services all together. If such is the case with children, what about adults who make excessive noise, as in coughing or sneezing too much? Are they to be denied entrance for not controlling their irritated throats and noses? To be consistent, such would have to be the case — for a coughing adult is no quieter than a toddler needing a diaper change!\nIf the reasoning behind keeping children out of worship is that it keeps things under control in the assembly, the people need to rethink their reasoning. They might think they are teaching the children the importance of worship by not permitting them to be in the assembly until they are quiet, but in reality it says the exact opposite. If worship is essential for Christian growth, which it is (I Corinthians 11:30; Hebrews 10:24-25), why are we not permitting them to witness and partake of it with us? How are we training them to worship God when we won’t even show them how to do it? Would we do the same with other “important” assemblies (funerals, weddings, etc.)? Even the Jews were taught to let their children see them worship so that “when your children say to you, 'What do you mean by this service?'“ they could then explain the need for worshipping God (Exodus 12:26-27). How can we do any less with a much greater covenant?\n[If the matter is over “Children’s Church” in place of worship, then such would be just as wicked because godly “men” are to lead in worship (cf., I Timothy 2:8), and not children or women. Creating a separate assembly for children (or women) just for the sake of letting them have the lead in worship is just another way of resisting God’s will for women and children to be in submission to men.]\nThere must be a balance in the noise that takes place in the assembly. Those who are making the noise should do all they can to control it as soon as possible (I Corinthians 14:33). Those who are not making the noise must show patience and do their best to concentrate on God. The solution is not to ban small children from worship, else adults with health problems would need to be kicked out as well. Instead, our emphasis should be on the worship and praise of God, which is why we are assembled in the first place (Ephesians 5:19-20). God tells us He is a God who “is greater than our heart, and knows all things” (I John 3:20), so why should I be impatient with someone who needs 5 seconds to get their noise under control? If God can still hear our prayers, songs and praise, why should I stop offering it to Him because of a crying baby or coughing adult? Is it in keeping with God’s character to be impatient with others? Or is it in keeping with His attitude to be inconsiderate of others when we are making excessive noise? Then why should His worshippers fail to demonstrate such qualities in the most sacred assembly on earth — worship? How ironic it must be to God for people to gather in His name to worship Him (a selfless and considerate being) yet fail to extend the same attitude toward one another. Can people truly love God without showing such love to others (I John 4:20-21)?\nquestion:What is the author's opinion on excluding children from worship services in church?"]}

{"question_id": 114, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nProtecting Repayment of the EB-5 Investment: How to Navigate the Jungle of Intercreditor Loan Agreements\nBy Mike Gibson\nEB-5 loans are often undertaken as subordinate loans. When in a subordinate position, an EB-5 lender should always consider whether it would be beneficial to request an intercreditor agreement from the senior lender in the transaction. If a lender’s and borrower’s negotiating power permits it, an intercreditor agreement could be a critical component in protecting the lender’s ability to repay EB-5 investors in a distressed project situation.\nIf the parties negotiating power does not support it, an intercreditor agreement can simply further erode a lender’s rights without any real benefits. Given that an intercreditor agreement can be a double-edged sword, a key early decision in a transaction is whether to require an intercreditor agreement as a lender, if one is not imposed by a senior lender in a transaction.\nIdentifying the Different Types of Loans\nBefore diving into the details of an intercreditor agreement, its important to understand the difference between a senior loan and a junior, mezzanine and subordinate loans, as these terms are often used interchangeably.\nA senior loan is a loan secured in the first and highest priority position by collateral of the borrower, in the EB-5 context, the collateral is often real estate.\nA junior loan is a loan secured by the same collateral as the senior loan but in a second or other junior position. A mezzanine loan is secured by a pledge of the ownership interests, like membership or partnership interests, of the real estate owner. The borrower is holder of such ownership interests and not the real property owner.\nA subordinate loan, whether a junior loan or mezzanine loan, is secondary to the rights of the senior lender on a project. The key rights that could be subordinate are the right to realize on or sell any collateral held by the subordinate lienholder or the right to payment under the subordinate loan.\nEach definition of the loans may have a nuance or altered meaning based on the specific terms and conditions of a transaction, however, the use of these terms means something to the average person that operates in the financial world and consistent use of these terms can avoid confusion regarding how a transaction is actually structured. In any of these structures, an intercreditor agreement should be considered by an EB-5 lender.\nKey Points to Consider in a Negotiation\nIf you can obtain a reasonable intercreditor agreement, there are certain key points that every EB-5 lender should consider in that negotiation, which mostly relate to preserving control or economic rights over a project as long as possible. The key points in an intercreditor agreement for a subordinate lender are to preserve the ability to foreclose on collateral for the subordinate loan, preserve the ability to receive debt service payments, obtain the right to take over a defaulted project and complete construction and development, preserve recourse against guarantors and obtain the ability to purchase a senior loan if an event of default occurs.\nOther key points include the ability to approve modifications of senior debt, in particular adverse changes in economic terms of the senior loan, and to have a standstill on the exercise of senior lender’s remedy of foreclosure for a limited period of time.\nAn additional benefit of being in a subordinate position is that the senior lender often will have the administrative infrastructure to monitor loan draws and the progress of construction of the project, thereby reducing the cost of the loan to the subordinate lender.\nEven though intercreditor agreements are beneficial, not all key points will be achieved in every negotiation. There are some items that a subordinate lender might have to give up in an intercreditor agreement.\nA subordinate lender will often be asked to give up the right to foreclose on subordinate collateral unless timely exercised, the right to repayment of subordinate debt if subordinate lender is unwilling or unable to cure defaults related to the project, the right to make independent decisions in a bankruptcy of the borrower, the right to pursue remedies against guarantors that are common guarantors with senior lender, the right to modify subordinate loan documents and the confirmation that EB-5 funds will be disbursed prior to senior loan funds.\nSo many rights of a subordinate lender are lost and key rights of the subordinate lender must be promptly and properly exercised or a borrower’s default can result in a total loss of an EB-5 investment in a project.\nWhen an Agreement may be Beneficial\nAn intercreditor agreement can often take more than it can give a subordinate lender. Given that, unless the EB-5 lender or borrower have leverage to obtain a reasonable, arms-length negotiation of an intercreditor agreement, a subordinate lender will often be better suited to close a loan transaction without an intercreditor agreement. An EB-5 lender will have leverage in a transaction when its funds are critical to completion of a project or the lender has the independent economic means to complete a project.\nA borrower will have leverage when it has a good, long-standing relationship with a senior lender or the ability to replace a senior lender with another party. A subordinate lender should consider these factors prior to even requesting an intercreditor agreement and after careful consideration, it could be a rational decision to proceed with a loan without requesting such an agreement.\nThe EB-5 loan has long conjured up an image of a covenant and compliance light loan structure on interest rate terms that are significantly more favorable than could otherwise be found in the marketplace for similar loans. The appeal to borrowers of such loans is understandable. However, the question was whether the regional center lenders and EB-5 investors were being properly protected in the prevailing EB-5 loan structures and documentation.\nThe evolution of EB-5 loans to more market loan structures and documentation terms is essential to the continued growth and viability of the EB-5 industry. Intercreditor agreements are a key part of that evolution. EB-5 investors are demanding loans and transactions that are structured on market terms and with market protections for their investment. Transactions that are structured solely as borrower-friendly vehicles without market protections for the EB-5 lenders and investors, will likely never find the investors needed to utilize EB-5 capital in a project.\nEB-5 investors should not view intercreditor agreements as a requirement to a solidly structured EB-5 subordinate loan transaction but they absolutely should consider whether such an intercreditor agreement can be obtained on favorable terms in a subordinate loan structure.\n(Editor’s Note: Chinese translations may vary slightly as published.)\nUse a Facebook account to add a comment, subject to Facebook's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

North Dakota had also been shutout in five of the first-six games to start this season.\nHowever, all that came to an end as UND received scoring from four separate players to power past the Bison. Additionally, three players scored their first collegiate goals.\nCaitlin Dahl scored in the 11th minute to give North Dakota the early lead. Fellow freshman Zoe Foster dished a pass to Dahl from the right flank toward the top of the 18-yard box. Dahl took a high shot that curled in off the crossbar and off the goalkeeper’s fingers.\nDahl’s goal would stand as the lone mark of the first half, as the second half would feature a flurry of scoring.\nWithin five minutes after the start of the second half, North Dakota extended its lead when freshman Robyn Wujkowski got her head on a loose ball inside the 6-yard box. NDSU’s goalkeeper Katie McCormick tried corralling the ball after it was played in, but a scramble that ensued between her and her defensemen allowed Wujkowski to get enough on the ball to put in in the back of the net for her first collegiate goal.\nUnfortunately, UND was unable to keep a clean sheet as NDSU’s Katie Tallas scored off a header in the 62nd minute to cut the lead in half.\nJust eight minutes later, however, Foster stole the ball in the attacking third and had room to carry it into the right side of the box. After a few touches, the freshman put the ball in the upper far corner for her second goal of the season, giving UND back its two-goal lead.\nThree minutes later, Wujkowski and sophomore Marissa Ricci created a two-on-one break after the Bison turned the ball over while pressing through midfield. Wujkowski passed the ball just outside of the box and Ricci finished the pay, chipping the ball over the goalkeeper for her first collegiate goal.\nWith time running out and North Dakota up 4-1, the Bison continued to attack, eventually finding a second goal with only 19 seconds remaining in the game. Meghan Johnston put back in a rebound after an initial shot was deflected within the 6-yard box, making the final score 4-2.\nKirsten Olsen also had a penalty-kick opportunity after NDSU was called for a handball inside the box. Olsen got the shot on net, but NDSU’s McCormick made the save.\nUND goalkeeper Kristi Hestdalen recorded five saves in the contest. North Dakota out-shot the Bison 21-19, with a shots-on-goal margin of 10-8 in UND’s favor.\nNorth Dakota returns to the pitch on Sunday, hosting Boise State at 1 p.m.\nquestion:Who scored the first goal for the University of North Dakota women's soccer team in their game against North Dakota State?"]}

{"question_id": 118, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nPlayStation 4 Launch Dampened by Dearth of Hot Games\n11/15/13 2:05 PM PT\nSony's first new console in seven years, the PlayStation 4, has finally hit the market. It started retailing Friday, but the launch was not without its glitches.\nAmong the reported hardware problems were some complete failures. Less catastrophic, some systems would not output a signal through HDMI. Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, said the company is looking into those reports.\nIssues cropped up for staff of game publication IGN after they updated the system with the Day 1 patch, intended to offer additional functionality that was not ready by the time units started shipping.\nSony did not respond to our request to comment for this story.\nLaunch Features\nFollowing the launch, users in North America could take advantage of the Remote Play system, which allows them to play many PS4 games through their PS Vita handheld devices over a WiFi network.\nThe Vita can be used as a second screen experience, as can many smartphones through the PlayStation App. The system is designed for easy recording and sharing of screen shots and gameplay. It can natively stream gameplay to Ustream and Twitch -- PlayStation Camera owners can also stream camera images and microphone audio in their broadcasts.\nUp to four users can log into a single system simultaneously. The party chat system lets friends chat independently of the applications and games they are using. Of course, the PS4 offers multiplayer gaming and Blu-ray and DVD functionality as well.\nEntertainment Apps\nThe system offers more than just gaming, with a multitude of entertainment apps such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, NHL GameCenter LIVE, and NBA Game Time for consumers to access movies, TV and sports content.\nThe console has digital-only output this time around, with Optical Audio, HDMI and LAN ports, and an auxiliary port for the PlayStation Camera. The 500-GB hard drive is easy to switch for one with a larger capacity or even a solid-state drive.\nThe power supply is built into the system casing, alongside an eight-core AMD x86-64 bit CPU, 1.84 TFLOPS graphics GPU, and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM, as iFixit reported in its teardown. The front of the until includes two USB 3.0 ports.\nHo-Hum Reviews\nEarly reviews of the PlayStation 4 are somewhat middling. The DualShock 4 controller and strong physical build of the system have won praise, but the somewhat messy user interface and the lack of exclusive, must-have games at launch have drawn criticism.\nMany of the launch titles are multiplatform games, and some are also available on the PlayStation 3. Since the PS4 is pegged as a gaming system more than a home entertainment center -- especially considering the system does not support external USB storage -- the lack of groundbreaking titles might cause some gamers to hold off on buying a system.\n\"I think by January, they need to be very clear about what software will be available in the near term,\" Billy Pidgeon, an independent video game analyst, told TechNewsWorld.\n\"It will be in Sony's best interest to make as much software available early in 2014 as possible,\" he added.\n\"There's always a dividing line between early adopters and the mass market,\" Ted Pollak, senior game industry analyst at Jon Peddie Research, told TechNewsWorld. \"In most console launches, the console software has not been optimized yet for the capabilities of the system. Whether we're talking about PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, some consumers may wait until the system has fully optimized titles. However, I think the people that wait for optimization are a minority.\"\nDelayed Game\nWatch Dogs was pegged as an important launch period title for the system and is hotly anticipated by many gamers. But developer Ubisoft delayed the game's release until the spring.\n\"Having high-quality launch titles is important in any console launch,\" said Pollak. \"However, all it takes is a few high-quality titles to satisfy most customers. ... People that were eagerly anticipating [Watch Dogs] specifically may hold off on purchasing the console. However, because the title is a new intellectual property and has not proven itself in the marketplace, the strength of that effect could be limited.\"\nSales Targets\nSony no doubt wants to storm right out of the gate with the PS4 after the PS3 lagged behind Microsoft's Xbox 360 in sales for much of those consoles' histories. The PS3 hit 80 million sales earlier this month, while the Xbox 360 had shipped more than 80 million units by the end of September.\nNintendo's Wii U launched last year, but it has had disappointing sales, so the race for marketplace dominance appears to be between the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\"Sony, in my market and from what I've observed, started advertising before Xbox in the United States, and they may be rewarded for that in the holiday season,\" Jon Peddie Research's Pollak offered.\n\"However, Xbox has recently launched their marketing campaign. They're significant and drawing consumers towards the Xbox also,\" he pointed out.\n\"Sony did have some wins, I think, that were basically picking up on some negatives from Microsoft, having to do with control,\" Pidgeon said.\nMicrosoft stumbled in its early messaging, though ultimately it backed off, he pointed out. \"There were some issues about whether games could be resold and whether the consumer would lose some value from that, which they feel very strongly about generally. The consumer wants to have resale value on the software. That gave Sony a bit of advantage, and they played further to that by concentrating on hardcore gamers, which is the early audience on PS4.\"\nCheaper Console\nThe PS4 already has a key advantage over the Xbox One -- it is retailing at US$399, $100 less than its rival, which debuts next week.\n\"The two systems are in a bit of a race to see which one can develop a larger install base sooner,\" Pidgeon added. \"The sooner there are 5 million, 10 million units in use out there, that gives third-party publishers the opportunity to have a million-seller [game]. Until you have 5-10 million of a particular console out there, it's very difficult to sell a million units of software.\"\n\nquestion:What are some of the features and functionalities of the PlayStation 4 at launch?"]}

{"question_id": 120, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nMARS in Capricorn is in his exaltation. his {348} quality expressed in the world of action is Theodore Roosevelt. One has only to contemplate his method to understand the full effect of Mars in Capricorn.\nIn the world of science, we have two men of incomparable vigor and persistence, Pasteur and Edison; while, to return once again to political life, we find Edward VII with this position of Mars. This is a very astonishing case; there is little of high ability to be found in this monarch, but Mars, rising in this sign, gave him the executive force to carry through the Triple Entente, one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in the world's history.\nGoethe also has this position; in this connection we notice the brusquerie of much of his verse, its leaping, forceful, direct quality. That any man could win such signal triumph is amazing; the art of poetry seems to demand smoothness rather than this abrupt sledge-hammer method. Rossetti, for example, with the same position, scores only partial success. The rough scansion of much of his verse must be called a flaw, whereas with Goethe it was a virtue. But Rossetti's Mars is in conjunction with Neptune and in opposition to Saturn, with no buttress to such aspects but a distant trine of the Sun, while Goethe's Mars is trine to Mercury and the Sun.\nRuskin and Tolstoi have also this position, but Ruskin's Mars is the storm-centre of a great complex, which considerably modifies the effect, while Tolstoi's is in conjunction with Neptune, increasing its eccentricity and violence by harnessing materialism with mysticism. A better illustration of the effect of this position is Savonarola. Here we see clearly the sudden fierce resolution and the tenacity of purpose. Afflictions by Saturn and the Moon tended to increase the asperity of the method, and doubtless they contributed to its failure; but the method is indicated clearly enough by the position.\nAmong women we have Cleo de Merode with the Moon trine and the Sun and Venus in square to Mars. From this comes her incomparable power to have her own way in everything.

Once the copter takes off, does the barometer \"see\" this altitude change? Would lidar be a good addition to have in order to get a true altitude reading once launching from the cliffs? Today was a practice flight for a trip this summer to PIctured Rocks on Lake Superior in da U.P. where I want to get some nice video of from above the water. I find it difficult to judge how far above the water the copter is and wonder if the barometer provides an accurate altitude so my equipment doesn't end up in the drink.\nAir pressure will not be different above (at your take off point) or beyond the cliff. Thus your barometer should read the same value and should not register any altitude difference once you go over the cliff and expose your copter to 20m altitude.\nAir pressure value changes from the mean sea level. Where you flew your copter was the same vertical distance from this sea level.\nGPS vertical data cannot be trusted at this situation either. So the only way to register the altitude difference in your case would be using some type of distance sensor (ultrasonic, IR etc.)\nThanks, I'm looking into LidarLite.\nI still don't understand how there can be such drastic altitude errors when using RTL/Land (by switch or Auto mission) in only a few minutes of flying. It happens at my home, field and yesterday at the lake and two different copters, one using Pixhawk, the other AUAV-X2.\nToday I had a small crash with 3.3 RC3+: Before landing accidently I switched to drift mode. After landing I want to disam via yaw stick but the copter flipped on the ground. I think it should be possible to disarm the copter in every flight mode. I know thats stupid to land in drift mode, but when done disarming should be possible.\nCheers Gregor\nI also happened with 3.3 rc1.\nLooking forward to RC4 Best guess on when it will be available?\nRandy is going to be trying for Sunday.\nTo all the developers,\nwill the \"follow me\" mode be smarter on the succeeding builds? I would love to see it perform better in follow me mode, like filming you from behind, or from your side. I think as of now, it is limited to fly above you.\njust sharing my opinion. :) thanks again!\nWe are continuing to improve the performance of the follow me controllers. As Randy says, the rest is done from the ground station.\nquestion:What is suggested as the only way to register the altitude difference when flying a copter over a cliff?"]}
{"question_id": 122, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nINSIDE THE STEPHENSON HOUSE - July 23, 2003\nHi! Henry the Stephenson House mouse is back again. Let\nme tell you, Ben's Birthday Party was great! There were lots of people\nhere enjoying ice cream and cake as they wished Col. Ben a happy birthday.\nMary, her committee and a lot of the FBSH Board members had \"my\"\nhouse in tip-top shape. They had the windows sparkling clean and yes,\nyou are right, it was George who mopped the floors. The living room was\na step back to the 1820's with the antique furniture and antique accessories\non the mantel and tables. The breeze wafting through the open windows\ncompleted a beautiful picture of Col. Ben and Lucy entertaining in the\n1820's.\nHenry saw lots of you folks at the party, including Bob, Henry and Shirley;\nEsther, David and Mary Deane; Corrine, Betty Jean and Jean. Hey, we had\ntwo Colonels' at the party: Col. Ben and Eleanor and Colonel Charles were\nhere! I watched as you all were enjoying the ice cream and that super\ndelicious cake of Dottie's. I watched and listened as you talked with\nthe folks dressed in 1820's clothing! I counted seventeen of Col. Ben's\nvisiting friends and relatives in their beautiful, authentic clothing\nand they were enjoying the day! Wasn't Elle cute as Elvira the Stephenson's\nyoung daughter?\nYou can see that the FBSH Board loves to give parties! This one was rather\nspecial in that contributions could be made to a fund for Col. Ben's new\nstaircase. Well, once again you all were very generous and contributed\nover $1600. The people of Edwardsville have a wonderful sense of history\nand a tremendous community spirit. Col. Ben loves it and so does Henry!\nThe researchers received another nice surprise. It was a letter written\nby Col. Ben to Daniel P.Cook on April 22, 1815. It was written as Ben\nwas on his way back to Kaskaskia from his first session in Congress. Ben\nwrote from Summerset: \" I arrived here this evening with my family,\nthe road is extremely bad, in four days more I expect to reach Pittsburgh,\nwhen I intend to take water to Furguson's ferry.\" In the letter Col.\nBen asked Cook to rent him a home at Kaskaskia, writing \"Get any\nhouse that you think will answer, we won't be particular for the present.\"\nHe also told Cook that he needed a place for a hatter's shop. A young\nman was with Ben and he wanted him to \"go to business immediately.\"\nBen also had the equipment with him that would be needed for the hatter's\nSo, it appears that Lucy and family did make the trip to Washington with\nCol. Ben. The researchers have never been too sure if she went with Col.\nBen or not. Then just the other day good old Cousin Jake came up with\nsome recollections! Jake recollects that Great-great-great grandfather\nSamuel used to tell how excited Lucy got when she found out she could\nvisit her relatives and enjoy seeing her children meeting their aunts,\nuncles and cousins. The Swearingen and Stephenson relatives lived in Martinsburg\nand Shepherdstown, Virginia, and both towns were almost right on the way\nto Washington. It seems just logical that she did not go to Washington\nbut took this opportunity to visit her family.\nIt is doubtful, though, that Lucy would have stayed in Washington with\nCol. Ben in 1815. The stories Ol' Henry heard about the streets, the living\nconditions and the social life in Washington plus the condition of the\nroads just to get to Washington at that time were scary! Most members\nof congress did not bring their wives and families until around 1850.\nSure sounds to Henry that Col. Ben brought his family home to Kaskaskia\nafter they visited relatives in Virginia. Congress had recessed for almost\na month before they headed back to Kaskaskia. It seems like the Stephenson's\nspent some time in Virginia before they began their trip home to Illinois.\nI have an idea that the researchers will tie all this together and they\nwill also find out where Summerset and Ferguson's Ferry were located.\nAs I said the birthday party was sure great and Henry even got some cake\ncrumbs! Then I really got lucky when I jumped in the car to go home with\nCassie. As I told Cousin Jake, I ate like a king for a couple days and\nno one knew I was there! I got back home when Cassie's mother stopped\nby Col. Ben's house and I just jumped out of the car! Col. Ben and Henry\nboth had a great couple days!\nRight now I am waiting for the columns for the porch to arrive - they\nwill be awesome! Folks, Henry is sincerely glad you took time for another\nlook at Col. Ben's house. I keep telling you, do not miss this restoration\nas it progresses!! When the upstairs area is ready for a group, you must\ncome see the upstairs rooms and see how the beams and wood were used for\nthe roof. You know, in the near future all this wonderful old brick and\nthe interior roofing will be hidden from view forever with plaster.\nThe big weekend and my secret visit to Cassie's have worn me out and I\nam going to go enjoy a long, long nap.\nSee ya' later,\nHenry\nquestion:Who mopped the floors for Ben's Birthday Party at the Stephenson House?"]}

Then someone must design that product. The product must then be presented to someone – usually a committee of people – who decide whether or not the product is worth producing.

So a person, or people from the first company who produced the item must present the product to a buyer or buyers from a second company who decides whether or not to stock that product.

{"question_id": 126, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nIntuition is more than just a characteristic of highly sensitive people. For us, it is a cornerstone of our existence. It is the way we interpret life, how we learn, how we can become visionaries and how we pick up on the unspoken. In my experience, intuition can go so far as to being able to sense the type of off-screen relationship two actors have simply by watching their on-screen performances together, as well as being able to pick up on aspects of their off-screen personalities. Intuition can decipher what or who is behind the masks that are often used to conceal a piece of reality that doesn't want to be revealed.\nIntuition isn't based on logical fact gathering, making it difficult to trust. A feeling that instantly makes itself known by permeating the soul, shrouded in an ambiguous cloud of realization, can be amazing and uncomfortable to handle. It’s amazing in the sense that you simply know things, almost instantly, without knowing how or why; uncomfortable in the sense that you're not sure you should trust just a feeling that seems to come from within.\nThere were many times when I second guessed that gut feeling, especially when it came to life decisions, other individuals' characters, motivations and intentions. After all, we're taught that the most important decisions in life should be based on facts, figures, what appears to be true, what will benefit us the most financially, and what seems to be the most logical. For sensitives, though, I think this approach can be an elusive trap that ignores our ability to sense, rather than dissect the answer.\nThe answer that logic leads you to can be diametrically opposed with the one that intuition gives us. I'm certainly not advocating that either approach should be abandoned in favor of the other, however, it’s been my experience that if your intuition is telling you \"no\" when logic is saying \"full speed ahead,\" you should stop and listen. Sometimes when you don't listen to intuition's \"no,\" it has a funny way of magnifying that \"no\" the entire time you're living with the manifestation of that decision.\nIntuition instantly permeates through the masks that people use in an attempt to conceal their authentic selves, perceptions, motivations and intentions. It also sees through the politics that are played, which can make those that have perfected the illusion of a political persona very uncomfortable around you. The ability to sense what and who's beneath the surface helps you discover what people are unwilling to disclose openly. Intuition senses the soul, that inner essence full of past history, present existence and future aspirations. It is invaluable in discerning who can be trusted, how someone really feels about you, what that person wants, as well as the potential the relationship holds.\nThe ability to tune into the information that collective consciousness can bring us is also a part of intuition. Some call it the voice within, but I believe that those sudden whispers of premonition and insight come from the spiritual realm. Psychic ability is a heightened form of intuition that we all have the potential to develop and tune into. The difference for highly sensitives is that this potential comes already built in. It is automatic, as natural as breathing when its intended use is to help others, or prepare ourselves for events we otherwise wouldn't be able to handle properly without forewarning.\nWe don't want to think that a feeling, a sense of what is, can be as accurate as an analytical trail of puzzle pieces forming themselves into a conclusion. There's no explanation for \"just knowing\" or a method of how you arrived at the answer. Many things in this universe are inexplicable, but one can't deny the awe of their existence. When we begin to trust and believe in what doesn't seem to make sense, what can't be physically touched, we realize that reality begins with the invisible.\nIt's what goes on behind the scenes that brings the show to life. Why should you deny its validity?\nReally awesome and insightful article. One of my favorites actually. I completely agree, and you bring up a lot of good points. I definitely can relate a lot of my own experiences to this.\nThanks! Glad you enjoy it. It's kind of scary how lucid this post is since it was only one month after my concussion.

My question to you is, is this my intuition or is it my HSP acting up and reading too far into it. and my other question would be, as HSP's how do we know when we are reading in too much on a certain subject or person? If you could email me at Motor-Spirit89@hotmail.com that would be great. any advice or tips would be GREATLY appreciated. i've learned to read subtleties but when it something or someone i like, i ALWAYS second guess it and either i end up looking like a fool or i miss my chance. :(\nI feel the same way..

{"question_id": 130, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nIn the course of the exciting work being done on Main Street, U.S.A., at Disneyland park, a piece of Disneyland history was opened up yet again.\nFans of the Main Street Arcade are familiar with its Welte Orchestrion – the large self-playing pipe organ that has entertained guests for decades. While the arcade is closed as part of the current Main Street, U.S.A., refurbishments, the Disneyland Electromechanical team is taking the opportunity to perform maintenance on this impressive instrument – which is older than the park itself. But you might be surprised at what is found inside …\nSince 1945 – thirty years after the instrument was first built – those working to repair and restore the Orchestrion have signed their names to an interior panel, and the tradition has continued to this day. Dave Allan, an electromechanical technician at the Disneyland Arcade Shop (which cares for all of the resort’s electromechanical devices – from coin-operated machinery and popcorn carts to park turnstiles and FASTPASS machines) first came to work at Disneyland more than 35 years ago to work on the Orchestrion. He first signed is name to the instrument in 1974, as you can see in the photo above.\nI visited Dave and his colleagues Ken Knibb, Joel Viado and Jeff Garcia late last year at the Disneyland Arcade Shop for the rare opportunity to see this giant machine being cared for by these talented technicians. Though it has been through maintenance before, those times have been surprisingly rare.\n“It probably won’t be opened again for another 30 years,” Ken told me. The instrument still has it original acoustics and pipes, but the team is working to restore it to as close as possible to original condition while still being able to be enjoyed by guests daily upon its return to the Main Street Arcade. When it does return, it will feature more of the original music that it was first designed to play.\nBe sure to check out the Welte Orchestrion when it returns in its full glory to the Main Street Arcade later this spring. And I’ll be back soon with an update on this amazing piece of Disneyland history when Dave, Ken and the Disneyland Electromechanical team are all finished with it – for the next 30 years, at least.\n12 Comments\nJanet on March 19th, 2012 at 7:14 pm\nHow nice was this! Thank you for sharing this story. What a talented group you have in maintenance.\nCynthia from CA on March 19th, 2012 at 7:26 pm\nI love this pipe organ…I plop in a quarter every time I visit the park and play the Mickey Mouse March…everyone recognizes it and stops to listen and watch…thanks for your great work in keeping it so well preserved! Can’t wait to see all the work finished on Main Street!\nTHERESA on March 19th, 2012 at 7:49 pm\nDo you have a date when the orchestrion will be up and running again?\nTrent from ON on March 19th, 2012 at 8:28 pm\nGreat story! I’ve always been fascinated by these automated music machines at the Disney parks. Many have faded away over the years but it’s great to see that some remain and that they are in good hands. The Walt Disney Company bought a collection of dozens of automated music machines from Paul Eakin in the 1970s. Much of the collection was sold in 1997 but many pieces remain in Disney Parks around the world.\nPenny on March 19th, 2012 at 8:36 pm\nI used to work for a company that builds pipe organs. Signing the inside, either as a builder or repairer is an industry tradition that I’m glad to see upheld at Disneyland (a place of great tradition). Pipe organ construction tends to be intended for very long term use. I know the company I worked for planned for a 150-200 year life span for their products.\nWhat an interesting article, thanks for posting it!\nJim on March 19th, 2012 at 10:01 pm\nI wish the arcade would make a return. It was one of my favorite things to see on main street at a kid.\nFred from CA on March 19th, 2012 at 10:06 pm\nVery cool!\nI love that pipe organ!\nDebora on March 21st, 2012 at 12:32 am\nI love learning about the small treasures and the talented and creative teams behind them. The love and passion that goes into disney is amazing. Thank you\nKrista on March 21st, 2012 at 12:43 am\nI love this post! Thanks for sharing it!\nMikey on March 21st, 2012 at 3:33 pm\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!\nI am so glad Disney is taking an interest in these machines again like when Walt Disney was originally in charge, it’s a real shame that the new owner today wasn’t in charge about 14 years ago. That was when most of these instruments were sold, including band organs, orchestrions, nickelodeons, dance organs, and music boxes too. There was (pre 1998) a Wurlitzer Pian Orchestra in the arcade, but that was sold too. This instrument was actually restored in 1998 and sounded GREAT! Until a new midi selector was put in which was not made for the instrument. trust me, this instrument will sound MIND BLOWING when the restoration is done! Just take the tip that the tune selector is not made for the instrument!\nMikey on March 21st, 2012 at 3:36 pm\nAlso, the instrument isn’t in that bad of shape, so it shouldn’t be too hard.\nChristine from CA on March 24th, 2012 at 1:28 pm\nI can’t wait for this to come back!. I wish the once behind Dumbo still played.\n12 Comments\nquestion:Who is responsible for the maintenance and restoration of the Welte Orchestrion at Disneyland?"]}

After falling behind 2-0 in the first they were able to score 3 goals in the second and held onto the lead until the last minute of regulation.\n- Atlanta outshot the Caps 39-25 in regulation and 43-30 overall. Johnson was named the third star of the game for his performance despite the loss.\n- The Caps killed off 6 of 7 power play chances by Atlanta, including a 2-man advantage lasting a little over a minute early in the third period\n- Despite the offensive firepower on the bench, the Caps once again were blanked in the shootout.\n- This game marked the second time Atlanta goalie Kari Lehtonen gave up three goals in one period over the course of a week; he also gave up a three spot to Carolina in a 4-3 loss on October 13.\nThings to Watch For:\n- Richard Zednik is known as a streaky scorer whose points come in bunches; his 2-goal performance Monday night could signal the start of an offensive outburst by the recently returned Capital.\n- Hanlon shuffled the lines before the last game and seemed to get good results, so it wouldn't be surprising to see the same combos out there again tonight.\n- Atlanta has lost two straight and four of their last five after a quick start to the season. The goaltending will be the biggest question heading into tonight's game - star netminder Lehtonen has given up 17 goals in his last 4 games and was pulled for the first time in the 5-2 loss to Carolina Wednesday night. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, backup Johann Hedberg will man the pipes tonight.\n- The Caps have gotten stellar goaltending performances almost every game from their duo in net, and I would expect nothing less tonight. The one thing to watch for is the shot total - the Caps continue to allow 30+ shots every night and may not always be able to rely on goaltending alone.\n- In the last three games, the Caps have allowed only 2 power play goals on 21 chances. The problem? 21 chances in 3 games...still not great. They were 4 for 4 on Monday night, so that's a good sign.\n- Ovechkin had 2 assists against Calgary but neither Alex has scored in the last 140+ minutes - this after starting the season with 14 of the Caps' 31 goals overall. I'm not too concerned though...if there's one thing those two can do, it's score.\n- Only 4 players on the Caps roster have yet to register a point, and all four have been scratched from the lineup at least twice.\n- Dainius Zubrus leads the team in penalty minutes with 22 - that's a penalty a game, and yet he's still been one of the most consistent performers so far. Go figure.\n- I haven't mentioned it yet because I was waiting for details, but it appears that Rrrrico Fata is no longer with us. *Sniff*. After clearing waivers, Fata chose to pursue opportunities in Europe rather than report to Hershey, and I wish him all the best.\nProjected Lineup for the Caps\nForwards:\n8-Ovechkin, 9-Zubrus, 17-Clark\n28-Semin, 24-Beech, 18-Pettinger\n21-Laich, 16-Sutherby, 10-Bradley\n87-Brashear, 15-Gordon, 20-Zednik\n2-Pothier, 26-Morrisonn\n6-Heward, 27-Clymer\n47-Muir, 52-Green\n1-Johnson, 37-Kolzig\nForwards:\n17-Kovalchuk, 20-Rucchin, 14-Sim\n13-Kozlov, 39-Kapanen, 18-Hossa\n23-Slater, 16-Holik, 19-Mellanby\n29-Larsen, 9-Metropolit, 11-Vigier\n2-Exelby, 25-Sutton\n3-Vishnevski, 7-de Vries\n5-McCarthy, 34-Hnidy\n1-Hedberg, 32-Lehtonen\nquestion:Who was the goalie for the Atlanta Thrashers in the game against Your Nation's Capitals on November 3, 2006?"]}

I'd recommend it to just about anyone! Very lightweight, thin and not at all bulky, I love the non-adjustable leg loops. This may be my perfect harness.\nI also work in a gym, so I'm often belaying for long periods of time, and I've ended up wearing this harness for 6+ hours just because it was so comfortable that I didn't feel like taking it off!\nSizing is an issue\n- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer\nI have been using the R280 from 2008 forever and love love love it. Not sure when the sizing changed but there are 2 major problems that would easily be fixed. 1. New models do not have a waist strap that is long enough. I have narrow hips, this would be so much worse if they were normal or large. I have the small and I can barely squeeze my hips through the harness (often I just unbuckle it). I cinch it down as tight as it goes, so a medium would be too big in the waist although it would be easier getting over my hips. The issue here is having to unbuckle the strap, not a great thing as when rebuckling if a mistake is made it could be fatal. Please, please make this strap longer! Yes it might flap around but that is insignificant to fitting well. The R280 has 4 \" longer. 2. The leg straps are not long enough. I am somewhat long waisted, so perhaps this does not affect alot of women. The leg loops ride up to my crotch which is incredibly uncomfortable after about 10 minutes belaying. A 2 week trip climbing daily left me with bruises around my crotch. Another 2-3\" of extension on the leg loops would allow this to fit almost any body type. Cross posting in hopes of getting the engineers' attention, I do not want to switch to another harness--these are the absolute best when they fit right :)\nBest Harness\n- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer\nI climb in this harness for 24 hours straight and I never noticed it once!\nStep Up Your Harness Game\n- Familiarity: I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions\nFit: Arcteryx fits small. I wear a small in Black diamond harnesses, and originally tried a small in another Arcteryx harness, and was bummed to find that it fit a bit tight around the thighs and almost too small around the waste. I probably could have made it work, but my thighs were a bit too muscular for comfort in the small. Got a medium and fits much better, although may be a bit larger around the waste. Chronic problem. For comparison, I wear a size 8 in arcteryx pants, but a 6 in most other brands.\nPerformance/Use: This harness is awesome – the material and fit make it super nice to climb in, the gear loops are more heavy duty than my previous BD harness. I only use it for sport/lead climbing, but have been pleased with performance.\nLightweight yet super burly\n- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer\nI've used a previous generation of this Arc'teryx harness for 5+ years and it's held up wonderfully - I've completely put it through the wringer and it's still in fantastic condition with no obvious wear and tear. I love that it's super light and doesn't feel like you're wearing a harness at all, yet it's comfy on long hanging belays. Great for hot days and long approaches, and doesn't start hurting if you're working a move and falling over and over.\nI use this for cragging, alpine climbing and canyoneering. I can fit two thin layers under the leg loops (wool long undies and hiking pants) if needed. I have a different harness for ice climbing and mountaineering when I need thicker layers and/or the ability to put my harness on while wearing crampons. I love that it stuffs so small and takes up almost no space in my pack.\nI'm expecting to get a lot more mileage out of this harness, and when it's finally time to move on, I will definitely come back and buy another one.\nThe most comfortable harness ever\n- Familiarity: I've used it several times\nI also love how low profile this harness is. It compacts down super small, which is great for getting to remote crags and bike to climb endeavors.\nYay! photo shoot!\nAm I even wearing a harness?\n- Familiarity: I've used it several times\nSo light and comfortable! that is what makes or breaks a harness! After having an Arcteryx harness I'm not sure I can go back to my other harness! Arcteryx's webbing design is truly the way to go. In the gym or on the big wall you cannot go wrong with the FL 355! Most people are skeptical about the non adjustable leg loops but they are not as bad an you would think. I actually preffer it because the buckles don't get in the way or get caught on anything. I love the minimalist weight of the harness Also the protected gear loops are nice too so you don't have to worry about the loop wearing as quickly as a fabric loop does.\nquestion:What are some of the features of the harness mentioned in the reviews?"]}

Arab terror is our daily reality.\nIf selected for publication, it will appear as soon as possible on Haaretz.com.\nA barrage of rockets was fired into Israel yesterday evening, apparently in response to the targeted killing of an Islamic Jihad operative in Rafah earlier in the day. Yet despite the renewed rocket attacks, the Israel Defense Forces said an escalation in the south is unlikely.\nLate last night, a rocket was shot down by the Iron Dome system near Be'er Sheva, while another one fell on or near a home on Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, lightly wounding a child.\nSeven rockets fired earlier in the evening fell in open areas and caused no injuries or damage.\nIn a joint Israel Air Force-Shin Bet security service operation, Ismail Al-Asmar, 34, was blown up in his car very early yesterday morning. Two other people with him were lightly wounded.\nIDF sources say that Asmar transferred funds to the Popular Resistance Committees activists and the Egyptian terrorists who carried out the terror attack near Eilat last Thursday and who were planning another attack from the Sinai peninsula.\nIslamic Jihad fired two mortars into Israel yesterday morning, in an immediate response to the assassination. There were no injuries.\nFollowing the mortars, the Home Front Command instructed residents near the Gaza border to stay close to protected areas and ordered mass events canceled in the south.\nIn the middle of the afternoon, however, the command decided to reduce the alert level. During a meeting between Home Front Command commander Maj. Gen. Eyal Eisenberg and Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin, it was agreed to allow the four-day Briza Music Festival in the city, scheduled to open last night, to take place.\nBut as evening approached, the defense establishment got warning that Islamic Jihad was planning rocket launches; the alert level was raised again and yesterday's performances were canceled. A new security assessment will determine the fate of today's scheduled performances.\nOther events canceled yesterday included the Jerusalem Festival, scheduled to take place in Netivot; and two soccer games, one between Betar Jerusalem and Hapoel Be'er Sheva, meant to take place in Be'er Sheva, and one between Ashdod F.C. and Ironi Ramat Hasharon, scheduled to take place in Ashdod.\nBetween 7 and 9 P.M., seven rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. Five fell in areas belonging to the Eshkol Regional Council, one fell near Ofakim, and the seventh fell south of Ashkelon. The Popular Front claimed responsibility for the Ofakim rocket.\nThe air force responded by attacking the Islamic Jihad cell that launched the rockets from Gaza City, killing one terrorist and wounding several others.\nHamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahar, meanwhile, termed the terror attack last Thursday near Eilat \"strange,\" saying Israel had exploited the attack to retaliate in the Gaza Strip.\nHe noted that no group had taken responsibility for the attack. Israel, however, insists that the Popular Resistance Committees were responsible for it.\nAlthough rocket firings resumed yesterday after two days of relative quiet, the defense establishment believes there will be no major escalation in the coming weeks, as Hamas has a clear interest in maintaining its self-declared cease-fire.\nAlso yesterday, a woman was wounded when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip fell into the Egyptian area of Rafah.\nquestion:What was the response of the Israel Defense Forces to the renewed rocket attacks?"]}
{"question_id": 134, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nEver get hungry during an opera show? At the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver, Saturdays are Italian Opera Buffet day at Oceans 999. What this means is while you're gorging yourself over so many options plate after plate, your bites are accompanied by live piano and opera performances. Is this one-of-a-kind experience worth the price of admission or should you instead make a date of having dinner and sitting down for a formal show? Read on past the jump.\nBuffet:\nI took my mom here for a pre-Mother's Day treat ($57/person) on Saturday May 5th and we got here right at 6pm. Everything was ready to go so I got to feast my eyes on the different stations:\nAppetizer Station\nThe appetizer station was filled with things like Caesar Salad, Cheeses, Breads, Olives, Pickles, Asparagus, Shrimp, Herb-Roasted Chicken, Pasta Salad, Beef Carpaccio, and more. It was hard to limit myself because I love carbs but I also had to save room for the entrées and desserts.\nMushroom Ravioli\nSpeaking of entrées, they're all served hot so I couldn't get a group shot of them all, but this Mushroom Ravioli blew my mind. I try to temper my expectations for any buffet since variety usually trumps quality, but at 6pm, these ravioli were al dente, full of mushroom filling, and demanding of a second helping.\nMahi Mahi\nAnother entrée that spoke to me was the Mahi Mahi. Coated in a tangy sauce, these were satisfyingly flaky but not dry. Seeing distinct pieces of it served was also a treat as I'm used to seeing sloppy filets at buffets.\nPasta Station\nAt the Pasta Station, the Pasta Man was all smiles as he stir-fried some farfalle (bowtie pasta) for me. I opted for the full works (a variety of scallop, shrimp, sausage, tomato, peas, and carrots) with my pasta. The pasta is all pre-cooked, so it's not as magical as made-to-order, but this is a buffet after all, so I think pre-cooked pasta is an acceptable compromise. During our 2 minutes of mild social intimacy, the Pasta Man revealed to me that on Sundays he's the Omelette Man.\nFarfalle Alfredo\nDessert Station\nIt's common to believe that a dessert station is what makes a buffet great because if the pastries aren't tasty, the whole experience can be ruined. Variety was the spice of life at this station with more choices than any other station at the Italian Opera Buffet. There were a ton of parfaits, cakes (including a pistachio one!), tarts, and puddings to choose from. I personally enjoyed the creme brulee seen below and could have eaten 6 of them if I wasn't busy trying all the other desserts.\nCreme Brulee and Strawberry Mousse Cake\nFeatures:\nThe Italian Opera performances are the main reason one visits Oceans 999 on a Saturday. This evening featured an intro of classic pieces on piano which soon led into a male opera singer and in the second set, a female opera singer. For those with stashes of Italian performance DVDs or playlists on Youtube, this is the real thing. No mics. No acoustic booster. It's all voice. It's all breath control. These folks covered the classics all night so my mom was very familiar with the songs. The performers take a break after each piece but are usually back within 10 minutes.\nOpera Singers and Pianist\nThe most modern opera song I recognized was Con Te Partirò (Time to Say Goodbye), first performed by Andrea Bocelli. While I've never seen Bocelli live, I can happily suggest this Italian Opera Buffet is the next best thing and I had the freedom to eat as I pleased throughout the entire evening -- something you would not find at a traditional opera playhouse.\nService:\nI wasn't expecting much service during the buffet experience but was happily mistaken. Plates were promptly taken away by the staff and a manager even asked how our meal was going. At one point we spotted a dirty glass (perhaps an old dishwasher in the kitchen?) but as soon as we alerted a staff, they came back within a minute with a fresh clean glass. It was actually pretty busy here this Saturday -- evidently some people love the idea of opera and buffet! I feel this is a pretty unique experience worth checking out if you have someone who would a casual evening of live opera. They take reservations on OpenTable and I'd recommend coming right at 6pm so you can get the freshest food and the whole operatic experience.\nNote: The buffet is the main feature here but you can also order à la carte from the dinner menu if you don't want the buffet experience.\nFinal Thoughts:\nOne-liner: A unique experience that combines a better-than-average buffet with legitimate live operatic performances\nHighlight: The freedom of dining and listening to live opera\nPrice per person: $57 (sans drinks, taxes, or gratuity)\nWould I go back?

The endurance race was the first race of the TUDOR United SportsCar Championship and was sanctioned by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). In a signing ceremony at the Daytona International Speedway, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Michael Carr, and IMSA President, Scott Atherton, announced a five-year partnership that will build on the success of the previous five years of putting advanced vehicle technologies on the racetrack through the Green Racing initiative.\nDeveloped and sponsored by the Energy Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, SAE International (one of the nation’s leading transportation engineering associations), and several automotive industry leaders, Green Racing aims to leverage the technology innovation of the racing community to develop and transfer cleaner, more efficient fuels and vehicle technologies to consumer vehicles.\nAll of the teams competing in the TUDOR Championship Grand Tour Le Mans class, which features commercially available vehicle technologies, have chosen to use E85 (fuel that is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Using this alternative fuel reduces the petroleum the vehicles consume by 62% and the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by 65%, compared to the previously-used oil-based fuels.\n“If racing Corvettes and Ferraris are performing well on E85, then you better believe it’s good for consumers [with flexible-fuel vehicles] to use in their cars,” Atherton said at Rolex 24.\nAt the end of this year’s season, teams in the TUDOR Championship that go the farthest and the fastest with the smallest environmental footprint will win the Green Racing Challenge award. These teams will serve as a model for sustainable transportation and prove that energy efficient vehicle technologies are capable of high performance in extreme racing conditions.\nGreen Racing is one of many Energy Department efforts to make motorsports more sustainable. The Energy Department and NASCAR recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to find ways to further incorporate transformative clean energy technologies into NASCAR operations.\nFor more on Green Racing, visit greenracingcup.org.\nquestion:What is the purpose of the Green Racing initiative?"]}

Farah Naqvi writes.india Updated: Sep 19, 2011 21:51 IST.\nIt’s inevitable that justice for the weak will be a political hard sell. And laws around the world seeking to secure justice and equality for the weak have been forged through fires of hot contestation. The first Civil Rights Act of 1957 in the US was greeted by howls of protest from White chauvinists.\nEven ‘liberal’ John F Kennedy chose political realism over principle and voted against it in Congress for he knew it had little popular support at the time. JFK became a ‘civil rights champion’ later; some say only when he sensed greater need for the Black vote.\nCloser home, the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, was preceded by a robust Dalit rights movement, and high profile cases of Dalit atrocities set the stage for its passage.\nBut the backlash soon followed and attempts continue till today to stymie its implementation. The Draft Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill, 2011, (PCTV) faces similar challenges.\nThese laws are different from the spate of legislative and policy measures in recent years ensuring basic entitlements. Take the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Education (RTE) — one promised employment to the rural poor, the other elementary education.\nThese are unexceptionable wares to peddle in the political marketplace of populist ideas, lending themselves easily to sound byte debates in TV studios, apparently the new testing ground for ‘popular will’.\nThe arguments that NREGA and RTE faced weren’t social or political, but economic (with neo-liberals asking: ‘Will there be too much burden on the exchequer?’ Or ‘Why do the poor deserve such generous hand-outs?’).\nBut special protection legislations, within a civil rights framework, seeking to install systems of justice for the weak are different. They demand that we as a nation acknowledge inequality and discrimination as a fact of our society, polity and criminal justice system. They demand the naming of particular classes of citizens as weak and others as strong.\nThey demand from our political class a will to embrace principles of equal, secular citizenship over the politics of populism.\nThe PCTV bill is anti-secular, it should be burnt, it should be put in a trashcan — these are are some of the unnecessarily strident remarks we’ve heard in recent TV debates.\nCuriously, the government’s discredited Communal Violence Bill of 2005 didn’t elicit such shrill abandonment of civilised discourse because the 2005 bill didn’t challenge the biased use of State power that allows communal violence to spread.\nIn fact, it augmented and further concentrated powers in the hands of the State (Modi would have embraced such a bill).\nThe 2011 PCTV Bill, by comparison, attracts vicious protest partly because it does threaten the communal violence machinery, by making the State accountable for discriminatory use of its powers.\nEvidence of this does not need to be excavated from the recesses of distant history — because State bias in cases of identity-based attacks is not a thing of the past, as critics claim. Look at the fate of Dalits and Muslims in recent weeks and months — in Madurai (September 2011), Moradabad (August 2011) or Bharatpur (September 2011); look at Tamils in Karnataka (March 2008) or Biharis in Mumbai (October 2008). They are why we need this bill.\nThere may be much in the draft PCTV Bill, 2011 that its critics can improve, but its core (robust State accountability) represents the hope of securing equal protection of laws for all citizens; of giving meaning to the idea of sadbhavna.\nPolitical momentum follows from acts of political courage and for true sadbhavna we need that courage from our political class.\n(Farah Naqvi is a member of the National Advisory Council.

HLNtv.com will answer some of the most-asked questions in a series of seven articles that will publish every day this week called Arias Trial FAQs, or frequently asked questions.\nIt is very difficult to say what could delay the Jodi Arias trial at this stage, because anything could happen.\nThe first jury couldn’t reach a unanimous decision about whether to sentence the convicted murderer to death or life in prison. So Arias is now facing a retrial for the penalty phase of her trial, and a new jury will be selected to decide what her sentence will be.\nThe new penalty phase of the Arias trial is scheduled to begin July 18. Judge Sherry Stephens also scheduled a status hearing on June 20 to check in with the attorneys about their preparations for the new phase of the trial.\nAt the June 20 hearing, either side could ask for more time to prepare their case for the retrial, and it will be up to the judge to decide if the attorneys should be given more time to prepare.\nAnother possible delay could occur if Stephens releases defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott from the case.\nHLN legal experts say this is unlikely to happen, because Stephens has already denied the defense team's multiple requests to quit the case.\nIf for some reason Stephens does allow Nurmi and Willmott off the case, new attorneys may need more time to prepare for the retrial of the penalty phase, since they'll have to get caught up on the case and the previous phases of the trial, too. This could potentially push the start date of the retrial later than July 18.\nIf new defense attorneys are not given an adequate amount of time to prepare for the case, it could help Arias' appeal of ineffective counsel in regards to her sentence.\nHowever, Stephens, who may want to avoid another delay, might not let Arias’ current attorneys, Nurmi and Willmott, off the hook., Arizona, right now.\nJoin the conversation...\nquestion:What could potentially delay the retrial of the penalty phase in the Jodi Arias case?"]}

For the public, there is no access to practices. For the media, there are a mere 10-15 minutes of open practices most days. For students, there's Thursday's open practice (4 p.m. with student ID).\nThat makes Saturday's game a rare public viewing for most LSU observers. With the curtain raised, here's what we look forward to seeing the most:\n1. Cameron's offense: We know most of the players in LSU's offense. Zach Mettenberger, Jeremy Hill, Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry -- you can go down the list of familiar names.\nThe big question is how they will be used in new offensive coordinator Cam Cameron's offense. Will the Tigers still be a power-run team, as they've been in recent seasons? Will Cameron spread the field with a lot of four-wide sets? Will running backs and tight ends be split wide? Will they throw it in the red zone or try to power it?\nCertainly, we don't expect to have Cameron's LSU offensive playbook figured out based on the spring game, but it will be interesting to see what is valued most in the new offense.\n2. Young ends ready?: Two of LSU's returning defensive ends have played sparingly, but figure to get a lot of spring game snaps given a numbers crunch LSU is temporarily experiencing at the position. Jordan Allen is a player we had been hearing has been on the cusp of earning more significant playing time before a knee injury ended his 2012 season. Danielle Hunter played on special teams a lot last year and looked like a future star.\nThey both were caught up in a numbers game behind a talented group of ends, including three players will will likely be taken in next week's NFL draft. Are they ready to replace that production?\nWe won't get to see Jermauria Rasco in action, however. A likely starter at one of the end positions, his spring ended with a shoulder injury.\n3. Kicking it around: With a new offensive coordinator and so many new faces on defense, the battle for the place kicker spot has garnered little attention. But it's a key spot, considering LSU's consistency at the position over the years and the Tigers' emphasis on gaining an edge on opponents on special teams.\nJames Hairston, who handled kickoff chores last year, is battling walk-on Colby Delahoussaye for the field goal spot. Can they provide the Tigers with the same consistency they received from Drew Alleman the last couple of years?\n4. La'el at left tackle: La'el Collins came out of high school with a reputation as being arguably the nation's best tackle prospect.\nNow a junior, we'll finally get to see him play tackle in a game. After starting at left guard last season, the spring game will be our first chance to see him start at left tackle for LSU.\n5. Man in the middle: D.J. Welter has been the surprise starter at middle linebacker throughout spring. Most expected the junior, who missed all of last season for academic reasons, to fall behind members of the talented 2012 linebacker recruiting class in the depth chart.\nSo far, Welter has been the guy with Lamin Barrow, who many expected to move to the middle to replace the departed Kevin Minter, staying on the weak side, where he excelled last season. Is this going to be the 2013 lineup or will Barrow eventually slide to the middle to make room for one of the talented sophomores, such as Kwon Alexander?\nquestion:Who is the new offensive coordinator for LSU's football team?"]}

Her free throw capped off a stirring 61-58 victory over Unicoi County in the quarterfinals of the District 1-AA girls basketball tournament Friday night at the Warriors’ gym.\nHappy Valley (16-14) advanced to play top-seeded Elizabethton (23-3) on Monday at 7 p.m. in the semifinals.\nIt was a season-ender for Unicoi County, which finished at 12-16 with five losses in its last six games.\nIn other quarterfinal contests, Sullivan East pounded Sullivan North 84-19 while Sullivan South ran away from Johnson County, 54-41.\nEast (26-6) will face off with South (16-12) on Monday at 4 p.m.\nTonight’s contests will be three boys’ quarterfinal games, beginning at 5 p.m.\nBlankenship had just six points at halftime, but burned it up in the second half to finish with 27.\n“She’s a pure scorer,” said Happy Valley head coach Larry Abel. “She has a will to continue to the next level, and she didn’t want the season to end.”\nIt was a matter of staying after it, said Blankenship.\n“We just kept saying, ‘Don’t give up,’ ” she said. “This was our game, and we deserved to be here. This is our house, and we protected it. We played well when it counted.”\nWith the score tied at 58-58, Unicoi in-bounded the ball 94 feet from the basket with 15 seconds remaining. Hannah Rice raced down the court, and went to the hoop for a layup attempt. But Kalee Johnson blocked it and recovered the rebound.\nIt was the fourth blocked shot of the game for Johnson, who also had 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n“We had her back there in center field, and she did a good job of stepping over aggressively,” said Abel. “She did a great job executing.”\nWhen Johnson got the rebound, she looked up and found Blankenship behind the defense.\n“As soon as she had the rebound, I knew to go,” said Blankenship. “I knew she would have her head up down the floor. She’s always good at looking ahead.”\nBlankenship caught the home-run pass in stride, and beat a charging defender to the basket. She got the layup to crawl over the rim and into the hoop as she was fouled.\n“I was nervous about it going in,” said Blankenship.\nUnicoi once again went to Rice, and she beat the defense to the frontcourt — only to have Kaitlynn Kincer make the defensive gem by poking the ball away from behind as Rice was setting to shoot a 3-pointer.\n“We wanted to keep the ball in front of us, but Rice did a good job getting around us,” said Abel. “It was an excellent effort from Kincer to get back and get the tip.

Some say that he was setting a new precedent in terms of what foods he would eat so that he could be reach Gentiles. Is there another way that this passage can be understood?\n[This article is based on exegesis of this passage by Dr. Mark Kinzer, adjunct professor of Jewish Studies at Fuller Theological Seminary.]\nIn 1 Corinthians 9, Paul writes;\n outside that law, like one outside the law—not being outside God’s law but within the law of Messiah—to win those outside\nThis passage has traditionally been understood to be Paul’s missionary principle of accommodation that would justify him living as a practicing Jew amongst Jews and as a non-practicing Jew amongst Gentiles.\nWhat naturally follows from this understanding would be that Paul would have viewed himself as sometimes exempt from observance to the Law of Moses. Is that actually what the passage is saying, or is there another way to view it?\nUnder, Outside, or Within the Law\nThis passage describes three groups of people; those “under the Law”, those “outside the Law” (sometimes translated “without” the Law) and those “within the Law of Messiah” (or “within the Law of Christ” in some translations).\nMuch hinges on the understanding of the expression “under the Law” and refers to the relationship a Jew would have legitimately before the death and resurrection of Jesus. It is compared elsewhere to a child who has not yet reached the age of maturity (Gal. 4:1-2) as contrasted with full adult “sonship”. From verse 21 in Galatians 4, it seems Paul is addressing Gentile believers in Galatia who wanted to be “under the law” because they falsely thought it provided something that they lacked though faith alone in Jesus.\nIn the passage in 1 Corinthians 9, the contrast is made between being “under the Law” with being “outside the Law”. The first refers to the status of Jews apart from the death and resurrection of Jesus and the second refers to Gentiles who apart from faith in Jesus and His death and resurrection are entirely outside the framework of any divine covenant.\n“Under the Law” is negative only in relations to the far greater status offered through Messiah’s death and resurrection, being “outside the Law” is entirely negative. Both of these terms are contrast with a third term “within the Law of Messiah” which refers to the new relationship to the Law established for both Jews and Gentiles through faith in Jesus.\nUnbelieving Jews “under the Law” might be seen to have enjoyed a relatively positive status compared to those “outside the Law” (unsaved Gentiles) however once both Jew and Gentile receive Jesus as Messiah and the fullness His death and resurrection afford us, we are brought together “within the Law of Messiah” and called to a life of partnership. This partnership does not eliminate all distinctions between Jews and Gentiles; the two are fully equal yet distinct. It is both Jew and Gentile being “within the Law of Messiah” that entirely changes the previous relationship that existed between Jews (who were “under the Law”) and unsaved Gentiles (who were “without the Law”).\nSo in the passage above, Paul is saying that when relating to non-believing Jews he lives as though he were “under the Law” – though he is in fact not “under the Law” but “within the Law”. He treats these ‘brethren according to the flesh’ as his genuine covenant family rather than relating to them from a position of superiority and separation. In seeking to win them to faith and the life “within the Torah of Messiah” he was willing to adopt a level of halakhic observance that would be expected within a strictly Jewish environment that would be inappropriate in the Jewish-Gentile setting “within the Law of Messiah”. So for example, Paul might participate in hand-washing in accordance with Pharisaical understanding of how it should be done; becoming as a Jew “under the Law” to those “under the Law” but not to act in such a way with the Jews “under the Law” so as to cause them to view Gentile Christians “within the Law of Messiah” as being in anyway inferior.\nLikewise, Paul says that to those “outside the Law” [Gentiles that had not yet come to faith in Jesus] that he identifies with them even though his is not “outside the Law” but “within the Law of Messiah”.\nPaul, who now eats and travels and works with Gentile Christians (those “within the Law of Messiah”) in the task of reaching those “outside the Law” [unbelieving Gentiles] and Paul demonstrates that he has the capacity to understand and empathize with them where they are at.\nquestion:What does the term \"within the Law of Messiah\" refer to according to the passage in 1 Corinthians 9?"]}

The analysis concludes at least four areas need work simultaneously: improving public education, addressing health issues, creating jobs, and lowering the cost of living in rural Alaska.\nEven in areas where there continue to be deficiencies, there also have been gains, said Greta Goto, director of the Alaska Native Policy Center. For example, there are more high schools but the dropout rate is troublesome, she said.\n\"I think it is a challenge we have to overcome,\" Goto said.\nThe report says since 1974, 155 new high schools have been built in Alaska, mainly in villages. And while 71 percent of Alaska Natives have high school diplomas now, up from 48 percent in 1980, the dropout rate almost doubled from 1998-2001.\nThe data show an increased migration of women and young people from rural villages to urban areas. The report says 58 percent of Alaska Natives still live in rural areas and 42 percent are in urban areas.\n\"More and more of our men are being left behind,\" said Carrie Brown, senior vice president of First Alaskans Institute.\nIf economic opportunities were increased and the cost of rural living reduced - especially energy costs - it would be possible for more Alaska Natives to stay in their villages and stop the \"brain drain,\" Brown said.\nThe report says 33 percent of unemployed Alaskans are Natives. Per capita income is $9,113 for Natives, compared with $18,819 for non-Natives.\nThe report found that significant gains have been made in health care. For example, 81 percent of Native children are getting immunized - a higher rate than in the rest of the United States. The life expectancy of Alaska Natives also increased from 46.4 years in 1950 to 69.5 years in 1997.\nHowever, the data show that obesity among Natives is increasing, as well as teen birth rates, tobacco smoking and use of marijuana.\nThe report says the Native population stands at 119,241, or about 19 percent of Alaskans. If the population continues to grow at the current rate, there will be an estimated 140,000 Alaska Natives in 2010 and 165,000 in 2020.\nWith the median age a relatively young 24, it is important to consider what to do now to provide for a better future, Goto said.\n\"These resulting choices will impact how our future is shaped as a people and as a state,\" she said.\nquestion:What are the four areas identified in the report that need simultaneous work for the improvement of Alaska Natives?"]}

While mental health is a new portfolio brought into existence after the last ACT election at the initiative of the ACT Greens, several other Australian jurisdictions have established specific mental health portfolio responsibilities.\nPsychiatric Workforce\nThe major issue raised with the Minister was both the immediate and medium term future of the psychiatric workforce in the ACT.\nAMA (ACT) believes there are ongoing and serious difficulties in the ACT’s public sector psychiatric workforce. The situation is currently being held together by the use of locums and the considerable goodwill and dedication of local consultants and psychiatric trainees, together with mental health service management.\nAway from the immediate crisis, the use of ‘Area of Need’ appointments and locums continues to be the primary means of dealing with the shorter and medium term issues in public sector psychiatric staff recruitment – a situation AMA (ACT) would like to see rectified.\nThe private sector workforce, while not in a similar short-term crisis, is still deficient in consultant psychiatrists and particularly so when it comes to the child and adolescent subspecialty. As discussed with the Minister, the lack of local private sector workforce is puzzling given the many attractive features working in Canberra provides to medical practitioners.\nWorkforce Plan Needed\nWhile there seems to be little alternative to the public sector’s use of Area of Need appointments and locums in the short term, AMA (ACT) believes it should be an urgent priority to draft a comprehensive workforce plan for the combined ACT public and private sector psychiatric workforce, both specialist and trainee. The workforce plan should emphasise recruitment and retention and specifically consider safety, working conditions and incentives to work and remain in the ACT.\nIt would make sense, given similar work previously undertaken by the RANZCP for the Victorian Government, if the College was involved in the ACT workforce plan, at least in relation to the public sector workforce.\nMental Health Advisory Council\nAMA (ACT) and the RANZCP both expressed concern over the lack of either a psychiatrist or GP on the Council. The Minister responded by stating that he recognized the need for suitable input to the Council from medical practitioners.\nFurther discussions with the Minister are to be held in order to determine how it is – whether through co-opting or other means – input from medical practitioners can be made available to the Council.\nOffice of Mental Health\nThe Minister has recently released a ‘conversation starter’ that seeks the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Office of Mental Health. The ‘conversation starter’ is designed to seek the views of stakeholders on the role and function of the new Officer of Mental Health.\nAll in all, a constructive meeting with Minister Rattenbury.

And a ruling in favor of it — even if that means at least one Republican-appointed justice upholds it — won’t make its critics suddenly find it politically palatable, said one of the law’s leading foes.\n“If the Supreme Court actually overturns the Affordable Care Act, I think that will get Democrats overall pretty engaged in trying to determine who the next justices are in the Supreme Court,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, who previously worked on health reform in the Obama administration.\n“[It] will make the Supreme Court a much more political issue coming on top of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, Bush v. Gore, and now the Affordable Care Act where the Supreme Court is really grasping arguments that have been considered way out of the mainstream in just the last few years,” Tanden said in an interview for the POLITICO video series “SCOTUS & Health Care: The Final Countdown.”\nBut a ruling upholding the law isn’t going to persuade its opponents to back down, either, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, said in a separate interview for the video series. Republicans already have made clear they see it as a defining theme of the fall campaign.\n“The law didn’t take on the rising costs, that [is..] its fundamental flaw, and many of its features are simply not going to be politically palatable,” said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.\nHoltz-Eakin said the law’s Independent Payment Advisory Board for Medicare is unpopular among Republicans and many Democrats. He doesn’t like how the exchanges and subsidies are designed and expects that approach would lead to fewer employers offering health coverage.\n“The policy has to change and the political debate will go on,” he predicted.\nIf the Supreme Court strikes the entire law this month, attention will turn to Capitol Hill, where Republicans have said they would “replace” the law with smaller incremental bills. And that’s just fine with Holtz-Eakin.\n“[If] you go back to 2009 at the beginning of this debate, there was a consensus among conservatives, liberals, progressives — whatever label you wanted to attach— that we had problems in access to insurance, but more importantly at the rising cost of health care,” Holtz-Eakin said. “The real flaw with this law is it did not address the health care cost problem. Republicans will be very serious about taking that on.”.\n© 2015 POLITICO LLC\nquestion:What is the predicted impact of a Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act according to Neera Tanden and Douglas Holtz-Eakin?"]}
{"question_id": 152, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nVladyka Hilarion: The Russian Orthodox Church\nCan Leave the World Council of Churches\nThe hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, led by their newly-elected First Hierarch, Metropolitan Hilarion of Eastern America and New York, took part for the first time in the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, which met last week. During one of the intervals between sessions, Metropolitan Hilarion gave an exclusive interview to RIA News. Andrei Zolotov spoke with him.\n—Vladyka, in your report here on the first day of the Council you emphasized that it was your first time here, and that, therefore, much was new and incomprehensible to you. Nearly three days of the Council have passed. What are your impressions and feelings now?\n—Firstly, this is a joy because we, the hierarchs from abroad, are sharing such fellowship with our brethren. Of course, we are not acquainted with many of them. But I think that many of the Russian hierarchs also do not know one another, because of the fact that many have been consecrated only relatively recently. This is a joy because we are working together and are able to learn more about the life and administration of the Church here, of those problems that exist here, and those problems that are common to the whole Church. The feelings that arise when we make the acquaintance of hierarchs and converse with them, when we discover such brotherly love and understanding, move us to compunction. We see that these men, whom we did not know except from one remove, learning of them from photographs or one news item or another, are quite remarkable. And now we share a fraternal fellowship. This is an edifying process.\n—You said in your report that you are not removing from the agenda the question of the withdrawal of the Russian Orthodox Church from the World Council of Churches. Were there any deliberations regarding this, either in the working groups or in the anterooms of the cathedral?\n—There has still been no official discussion. But many hierarchs have approached and expressed their agreement with this; they were gratified that this question was brought up. And really, the people of God are everywhere awaiting this. It would ease our position considerably abroad, where many—clergy and laity—have gone into schism because of this very question. If membership in the World Council of Churches is reconsidered—perhaps we could have observers there as does the Roman Catholic Church—this would probably have a positive affect upon the attitude of many people who feel that past participation in the World Council of Churches and other similar cases of ecumenical interaction have passed the bounds of what is permissible. If this could be corrected, it would be a great joy for the whole Church.\nWe must not fear that our witness to Orthodoxy will be in any way diminished. On the contrary, when people see that the Orthodox Faith is confessed in our people's life, it will attract them. That our Church changes nothing, that it continues the apostolic, patristic teaching and all the Traditions of the Church—this is precisely what attracts people in the West away from Protestantism and Catholicism. They see that the Church does not alter its doctrine or its practice depending on modern trends; rather, everything that was set forth by the Savior and the apostles is maintained in Orthodoxy. It is because of this that people come to Orthodoxy. And this will continue in even greater measure, because in contemporary Protestant churches, and in Catholicism itself, the falling-away has been great.\n—Speaking of the growth of Orthodoxy, the question of missionary activity has also been raised at the Council. You have your own experience of mission amid the non-Russian-speaking, heterodox milieu. What, in your view, is important for mission in the modern world?\n—Firstly, what is needed is internal mission. We need to return our Russian people to Orthodoxy—those who have yet to receive Holy Baptism, who still have not come to faith. This is an immense task. And our objective in the West is similar, because we must first work with our own flock. With our youth, when there are mixed marriages among them, for example. In that case it can happen that they gradually drift away from the Church. Perhaps the husband or the wife will convert to Orthodoxy, but often this does not have a lasting, positive affect. Assimilation is also a great problem. For this reason, we are working with our youth, to strengthen them in the Church. But we also bear witness to those outside. We are always ready to receive them if they have a sincere intention to come to Orthodoxy. We prepare them, we lead them through the process of catechesis, and then we receive them—either through Holy Baptism, or sometimes through Chrismation.\nIt is not our practice, as it is among certain religious groups, to go from door to door, etc. No. People learn about Orthodoxy from literature, from their friends, through family contacts, through religious publications. People come by various routes.\n—Even before your election as First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia you traveled to Latin America, trying to bring back those who had gone into schism. What today is the situation of those who went into schism from the Russian Church Outside of Russia after the reunification with the Moscow Patriarchate.\n—In Latin America there has as yet been no progress. There are not many clergy there; only several priests in a few countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and Chile, for example, have left. I spoke with them all. They told me why they felt compelled to leave. Of course, they were isolated. Their bishop died several years ago, and we were unable to find a replacement for him immediately. Now there is a bishop [a new bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia was consecrated for Latin America literally on the eve of the Council of Bishops—RIA News], but prior to this there was no archpastoral oversight in situ. And they felt that the questions they raised received no response. I think that this happened because they were ill informed. And perhaps their isolation tended to preserve old concepts, understandings of the past, when the hierarchs here in Russia were objects of mistrust. Perhaps because they had no opportunity to visit Russia and see the change that had taken place here, that the Church is entirely free. But the question of ecumenism is disturbing to many. In Australia also, those who departed pointed precisely to the fact that the Moscow Patriarchate belongs to the World Council of Churches. This is the main reason why they left.\n—Vladyka, experience here in Russia shows that the same people who have protested membership in the World Council of Churches are the ones who are pushing for the canonization of Ivan the Terrible, etc.\n—Of course there are extremes. But I am speaking about ordinary parishioners who are troubled by this. There are people who will never be satisfied and will always seek reasons for this. But they do not constitute a significant part of the faithful..\"\nquestion:What is the main reason for some members departing from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia after the reunification with the Moscow Patriarchate, particularly in Australia and Latin America?"]}

I'm pleased with what I came up with, seems to be fitting with the trends. I kept with a black and white theme with hints of Tempting Turquoise and Gold. I decided to make my treat bag house a little card - cute eh?!\nI also added a poinsettia from the {Reason for the Season} stamp set - stamped with Tempting Turquoise Classic Ink to tie in more turquoise colour.\nI used {Hardwood} - the awesome background stamp from the Annual Catalogue to create the background for the antlers. I did sponge it also for a bit more pop.\nHere's to the unconventional... I hope you like it, have a super day!!\nStampin' Up! Supplies Used:\nStamps: Wonderland; Reason for the Season; Six Sayings (host)\nPapers: Winter Wonderland Specialty Designer Series Paper, Whisper White, Tempting Turquoise & Basic Black Card stock.\nInks: Archival Black Ink; Tempting Turquoise Classic Ink; Versamark\nAccessories: Metallic Doilies; Paper Snips; Mini Treat Bag Thinlits Dies; Gold Satin Ribbon; Metallic Gold Thread; Gold Embossing Powder; Heat Tool; Handheld Stapler/Silver Staples; Triple Banner Punch\nThanks for stopping by, happy stamping!

These diversity stars included Anna Escobedo Cabral, U. S. Treasurer; Carly Fiorina, former Chair & CEO of Hewlett Packard; and Retired General Colin Powell, former Secretary of State. They were the keynote speakers for the Third Annual Pennsylvania Diversity and Leadership Conference & Exposition. All presented very passionate and personal accounts of their experiences with diversity in America and as leaders. Their presence and presentations were inspiring to conference participants. Their unique perspectives on diversity were transcended by the common thread of great respect for the human dignity of all. They also shared the stage for being recognized as trailblazers in some aspect of their lives. They sincerely and passionately delivered messages of hope that Washington and this nation would truly embrace the words of our forefathers who penned the critical tenets of diversity in the opening statement of the Declaration of Independence, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nOther features of the conference included the following pre-conference summits:\n- Heathcare\n- Women of Color\n- College Students\n- Law Firm\n- Media\n- Supplier Diversity\nAdditionally, the many concurrent sessions provided a setting where diversity leaders and experts were able to share recent diversity knowledge and practices. The sessions were designed to actively engage participants and facilitate participation. Topics included leadership, mentoring, recruiting and retaining the best talent, talent management, and several aspects of diversity management generally.\nMany corporations and organizations came to exhibit what they had to offer in terms of diversity services and products. Nearly 30 exhibitors benefited from the hundreds of participants attending the conference. Special events were organized to specifically bing the participants to the exhibit area. In the words of Dennis Kennedy, the Founder & CEO of the Washington Diversity Council, \"The Conference is definitely a great opportunity for Texans to learn, grow, and understand, not just celebrate, our diversity. It is important that we learn to leverage our diversity to create a better Washington\".\nThe stars that appeared during the day on May 15 & 16 will forever illuminate the paths of the participants on the diversity journey to complete inclusion and equity. What part of the galaxy will participate in 2010? Inquisitive and inquiring minds should stay tuned to.

We are delighted to share with you the full report of that meeting.\nStrategically planned to coincide with the first-ever African Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights, the meeting was a milestone for the ACCA and laid the foundation for the coalition to be sustainable and locally-led. Key goals achieved were:\n- Defining what the ACCA stands for in a vision, mission and strategy statement that participants generated and agreed to;\n- Defining the coalition’s governance structure;\n- Electing seven civil society organizations to serve on the coalition’s regionally and linguistically balanced steering committee;\n- Agreeing on the contours of a visionary action plan.\nThe meeting was convened by Global Rights, and made possible through the generous support of Australian Aid, an anonymous donor, American Jewish World Service, the Fund for Global Human Rights and Oxfam Novib. A special thanks is extended to the meeting’s three facilitators, led by Sheila Keetharuth and supported by Meetali Jain (Centre for Human Rights, University of Pretoria) and Lien De Brouckere (Global Rights).\nAs a significant demonstration of its voice and power to engage on the issues on the continent, ACCA had robust participation in the African Regional Forum on Business & Human Rights. Representatives of ACCA member organisations spoke as panelists on 9 of the Forum’s 12 sessions on a wide range of topics, and the ACCA issued a statement on the Forum.\nThe full report is available in English and French.\nquestion:What were the key goals achieved in the Second Meeting of the African Coalition for Corporate Accountability (ACCA)?"]}

It started with an announcement of the cast members, instead of the cold open. This opening montage featured a still photo of each cast member in the middle of the screen against a background of lights that looked like sped-up traffic. Kenan was the first one announced. Then there was a short opening sketch, which was barely an opening sketch. Alec Baldwin, the night’s host, was in the opening. At the end of the opening, nobody said, “Live from New York…” – it instead cut to the montage. Kenan was again the first cast member announced. After the montage, Amy Poehler introduced Maroon 5, who then performed. Amy remained on the main stage during the performance. It turned out that Amy was romantically involved with Adam Levine. This didn’t make sense to me, because, last I heard, she was still married to Will Arnett. I was wondering why Maroon 5 were performing, since Radiohead were the musical guest. Then I saw some indication that Amy wasn’t actually involved with Adam Levine and that she was still married to Will Arnett. But, ultimately it wasn’t clear either way.\nAdvertisements\nquestion:Who was the first cast member announced in the season premiere of SNL?"]}

They largely relied on direct mail and print advertising,\ncommunications that were one-way, not to mention expensive,\nscattershot and impersonal. The old-technology equivalents of Mr.\nDavenport's Monday morning e-mail blasts were the \"bounceback\"\ndiscount coupons blown into Playbills and usually left to confetti\nTimes Square. The \"Altar Boyz\" messages are much \"stickier\": people\napparently pay attention to them because they come across as personal\nand interactive. \"When you see a show you love, the moment after you\nsee it is the moment you're most excited about it,\" Mr. Davenport\nsaid. \"My job is to capture that feeling, as close to the event as\npossible, and turn it into word of mouth.\"\nWord of mouth has always been the ideal. But the Internet has provided\na new and, some say, vastly improved set of tools to generate it: not\njust e-mail blasts but also Web sites, banner ads, search-engine\npop-ups and blog coverage. In the last few years these tools have\nreshaped the way the theater reaches its audience.\nThe most obvious change is in ticketing, which the Internet makes\nsimpler for customers and cheaper for producers. During the 2004-5\nseason the portion of Broadway tickets sold online more than\nquadrupled to 29 percent from 7 percent; this past season it continued\nto creep up, to about 33 percent. (For non-group ticket sales, the\nfigure is more than 60 percent.) The remaining tickets were purchased\nvia phone, group-sales brokers, the TKTS booths and the old-fashioned\nbox office, which now accounts for only one-quarter of purchases,\nmaking lines around the block mostly a thing of the past.\nBut that's just technical, a change in how people buy what they were\ngoing to buy anyway. A much bigger change involves tapping audience\nmembers' social networks to bring in entirely new theatergoers. This\nsummer \"The Color Purple\" is rolling out a Web campaign called\n\"Organize Your Group\" to help families, schools, gospel choirs and\nchurches arrange theatergoing \"reunions\"; an earlier form of this\nprogram has already referred more than 100,000 people to the show.

Pale boys with defeat in their eyes walked in horizontal gangs; they giggled at the aerobics of unattainable women. And they did not give way to the hasty girls. Ayyan loved this about the city-the humid crowds, the great perpetual squeeze, the silent vengeance of the poor. In the miserly lifts and stuffed trains, he often heard the relief of afternoon farts, saw scales on strange faces and the veins in their still eyes. And the secret moustaches of women. And the terrible green freshness when they had been newly removed with a thread. He felt the shoves and pushes and the heaviness of paunches. This unnerving constriction of Bombay he loved, because the congestion of hopeless shuffling human bodies he was born into was also, in a way, the fate of the rich. On the streets, in the trains, in the paltry gardens and sudden beaches, everybody was poor. And that was fair. The desperate lovers were still arriving and they quickly stole the gaps on the parapet between other fused couples. And then they, too, sat facing the sea with their backs to the great passing crowds, arranged their bodies and did their discreet things. Among these lovers were married people, some of them even married to each other. When night fell, they went back to their one-room homes, which were as large as a Mercedes, to rejoin their children, elders, siblings, nephews and nieces, all heaped under a single roof in gigantic clusters of boiling tenements. Like the BDD chawl, the mother hell. People who knew what BDD stood for were not the kind who lived there. But Ayyan knew such things, even though he was born on a cold floor there, thirty-nine years ago……He walked down the dim corridor of the third floor, which was the top floor. It was flanked by ageing pale-yellow walls with huge cracks that ran like dark river systems. There were about forty open doors here. Unmoving shadows sat on the doorways and gaped. Old widows calmly combed their hair. Children ran happily on the ancient grey stones of the corridor. He knocked on the only door on the corridor that was shut. As he waited, he felt the turbulence of all those open doors, and the milling shadows.”\nManu Joseph (Kottayam, 22 juli 1974)\nDe Amerikaanse dichter en schrijver Stephen Vincent Benét werd geboren op 22 juli 1898 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

{"question_id": 167, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nOccupy Wall Street demonstrators move through the streets of lower Manhattan near the New York Stock Exchange during a \"day of action\" in New York, November 17, 2011\nEven before the NYPD raid that cleared Occupy Wall Street from its base camp before dawn on Tuesday, the Nov. 17 “Day of Action” promised to be big. The two-month anniversary of the movement’s beginning–with marches planned on Wall Street and across New York City–got an inadvertent boost from the Zuccotti Park eviction.\nEarly this morning, at least a thousand protesters assembled in Zuccotti Park, the lower Manhattan space that served as their base camp from September 17 until the NYPD evicted them. The occupiers held their usual nightly general assemblies, but the park’s new rules, which a Manhattan judge ruled the city can enforce, prohibit the use of tents and sleeping bags as well as sleeping overnight.\n(LIST: Top 10 Most Influential Protests)\nToday’s “day of action” began when protesters filled the park and then marched on Wall Street. Armed with the protesters’ plans, which have been on the web all week, police set up barricades around Wall Street and another set of barriers one block to the north and south. Protesters clashed with police at several intersections, and around 100 were arrested in the morning march, but most of the protests have been peaceful. On Pine Street, one block north of Wall Street, the 200 assembled marchers used the “people’s mike” to allow protesters to tell their stories of economic strife.\nPerhaps the biggest confrontation occurred back at Zuccotti Park when the march was mostly completed. A small group of protesters grabbed the barricades and dragged them from the park’s perimeter, causing cheers of, “Whose park? Our park!” One of the protesters tossed a barricade in exuberance, which caused police to move in. There were reports of police throwing barricades in an attempt to move in and break up the scrums, but order was restored quickly.\nEven before the marches began, it was clear that Tuesday’s raid galvanized supporters to the day of action. As TIME’s Ishaan Tharoor wrote, one organizer estimated that the eviction may have tripled the number of people who came out in solidarity. Organizers are hoping that momentum carries into this afternoon, when union members will rally with the protesters at Foley Square. The last time the unions march in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, more than 12,000 people filed past City Hall. This time, they plan to march across the Brooklyn Bridge, where 700 protesters were arrested in October. Given the turnout this morning, this afternoon will be large, and if there are mass arrests again, it could be a long night for the NYPD.\nBelow, TIME talks to Tim Pool, who has been livestreaming Occupy Wall Street for two straight days.\nPHOTOS: Occupy Wall Street Protests\nVOTE: Should the 99% Be TIME’s Person of the Year?\nNate Rawlings is a reporter at TIME.

{"question_id": 169, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nMy little one just turned two yesterday. Two!! I can't believe it!\nI have a little cake book with instructions on how to make different shaped cakes. I picked two out I thought she's like and asked my husband which one he thought would be best. He said, \"Elmo.\" That wasn't one of the options. :) But he was right. She would really like an Elmo cake. Elmo's World is her favorite part of Sesame Street.\nI cooked a 8\" round cake, and let it cool over night. The next morning I took a long serrated knife (I used my long bread knife) and cut off the rounded top and made it flat. Next I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes. This helps firm up the cake for the shaping process.\nThen I used a serrated knife (this time I used a steak knife) to cut around the shape to make the basic outline. I cut some of the jags of the fur, but found as I was frosting it this wasn't necessary. The frosting helped make the appearance of fur, so I could have just cut the bottom outline rounded, not jagged.\nNext I took the paper off by sliding it over the toothpicks and leaving them in place. I then used my knife to score the outline of his features. They weren't all visible, but it helped.\nI then made my buttercream frosting and but a several spoonfuls in a separate bowl. I thinned this portion out a little more with milk for a base frosting.\nA word on base frosting. I'd never used a base frosting before, but decided to give it a try. The idea is you put a thin layer of frosting on before the decorating layer. It is supposed to help hold in the crumbs so they do not show through your decorated layer. I wasn't sure if it worked until I tried doing my decorating frosting on some of the edges that I missed with base frosting. It DEFINITELY made a huge difference. The areas I missed with the base frosting were crumbling and falling apart. Also, my little cake book has a separate recipe for base frosting, but I didn't want to make two kinds of frosting so I just thinned out some of my buttercream and it worked okay. {Call me lazy.}\nLet the base frosting dry for 20 or more minutes. During this time I started to make some of my colored frosting. For the each color I put the amount I would need (guesstimated) in a separate bowl to mix it.\nFor orange I used liquid food coloring: one part red, three parts yellow.\nFor black I bought a tube of decorating black. I cheated. :)\nFor red I bought some red food coloring paste. I've tried the liquid and gels before and they just create a dark pink no matter how much I put in. With the paste I was actually able to get a nice red. It did take quite a bit though. It helped that I was only doing a small amount rather than the whole batch of frosting.\nBecause I only put a thin layer of base frosting on I was able to still see a lot of my scored outlines of his features. The rest I was able to fill in by looking at the picture.\nFirst I frosted the orange nose, then the white eyes. When doing this parts I started by putting the majority of the frosting in the center of the area and carefully spreading it to the edges.\nI used my black tube to do the pupils. I only made the outline and it came out thick enough that I was able to carefully spread the line inward to fill in the circle.\nNext I made the outline of the mouth, but I suggest NOT DOING THIS YET! I wish I would have frosted the whole area below the nose and eyes red and then frost the mouth on top of it. The way I did it I kept getting black frosting smeared in my red.\nWhen spreading the red frosting, make sure it's a little thicker. This allows you to put it on textured so that it looks like fur. It's nice that you don't have to worry about putting it on smooth in this instance.\nI filled in the mouth similar to how I filled in the pupils. I made extra lines with the black tube inside of the mouth outline then carefully spread them around to fill it in.\nMy 2 year old nephew would love this, I will have to give it a whirl soon. I am already his favorite auntie, but this would secure that postion.\nThat is absolutely brilliant. Thank you for sharing how you did it.\nBrilliant Elmo cake! Love it!\nThanks for linking to a Round Tuit!\nHope you have a fabulous week!\nJill @ Creating my way to Success\nwow! That is so cute!!! You did an awesome job creating that! Thanks so much for sharing at Thursday's Temptation.\nJill\nCan't help smiling reading through this- I loved that you linked this up at Seasonal Celebration Sunday!- thank you! Rebecca@Natural Mothers Network x\nAAAH! That is so cute!! It looks just like Elmo!! Sometimes you see cakes that are supposed to be characters but don't look quite right...not so with this! You nailed it! My son would love it. I thought at first that his eyes were cupcakes, but I'm even more impressed that you cut the cake that way. Thanks for linking at Shine on Fridays!\nDang it...where were you last weekend?! I had an Elmo party for my baby girl and she turned two as well. I really wanted to make an Elmo cake, but decided to just Elmo-ify everything else (like cookies, cupcakes, cake pops).

Tirtha Maharaja explains how the Vrajavasis entered the yajna (sacrifice) at Kuruksetra during the solar eclipse on the occasion of the original Ratha-yatra in Krsna-lila, recounting the sweet explanation found in Orissan texts. In this article, originally a lecture delivered at the Calcutta branch of Sri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math, the day before Janmastami in the year 2000, Maharaj discusses the inner meaning of Krishna's divine pastimes during both Ratha-yatra festival and Janmastami.\nVamsi das Babaji: \"Weep for Krishna!\"\n:\nIn 1859, in the Village of Majitpur in East Bengal, Vamsi das Babaji appeared in this world. This year, his disappearance tithi fell on 12 August. We devotees in the west have been fortunate enough to have the association of Srila Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha Maharaj in the summer months for the past several years, and many of us have had the special boon to spend this auspicious tithi in his presence. On this day, Maharaj relates the life and teachings of this esoteric Vaishnava saint in a moving and memorable way, emphasizing the teachings of Vamsi das that to reach the ultimate goal of life, we must, \"Weep! Weep for Krishna!\" One such lecture, entitled \"What is Bhakti?\", delivered in 1999, appears in the book \"A Taste of Transcendence\". An excerpt from that lecture appears here.\nJagadish and Jagannatha Deva\n:\nDeep in the jungles of West Bengal, on the road from Calcutta to Mayapur, lies the tiny village of Jasra. A hidden jewel lies there, in the form of this beautiful deity of Lord Jagannath, Who originally lived in the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Orissa. Jasra is famous for the wonderful snan-yatra festival held there every year wherein thousands of villagers flock to the temple there, now in the care of the Sri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math. How the Lord of the Universe came to live in this tiny, out-of-the-way place is a wonderful story, narrated by His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha Maharaj in the new book, \"Sri Chaitanya: His Life and Associates\". In this article, Srila Tirtha Maharaj gives us a delightfully colourful account of Lord Jagannath's journey to Jasra and His pastimes in the area, including the history of the temple.\nSrila Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha Maharaj in San Francisco, August 2002\nA full account of Srila Gurudeva's pastimes in San Francisco, August 2002 by Sriman Subal das.

{"question_id": 171, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nGillian Flynn's Gone Girl Will Be Found In A Theater Near You\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn immediately got our attention in June. This creepy psychological mystery won the June 2012 RT Seal of Excellence. We couldn’t get enough of this read, and we weren’t the only ones. This deeply disturbing tale shot up the bestseller lists and has already been getting some serious award buzz. So it is no surprise to hear that Gone Girl has just been scooped up for a film adaptation.\nThe story unfolds around married couple Amy and Nick. They’ve recently relocated from New York City to the middle of the country in a move that Amy is none too happy about. But when, on the day of the couple’s fifth anniversary, the young wife goes missing — is it a simple kidnapping or something much more foul?\n20th Century Fox reportedly spent seven figures to acquire the rights to turn Flynn’s mystery into a movie. That kind of serious money behind this adaptation can only mean one thing — a fast track to theaters. And readers worried that the big screen version won't live up to the book can breathe a deep sigh of relief because the author has already signed on to write the screenplay herself. Another notable name attached to the adaptation is actress and producer Reese Witherspoon. (However, there’s no word yet on if she plans to star as the mysterious missing Amy.)\nWith its cast of not-quite likable characters that kept us guessing right up to the very end, we had a very fun time creating our dream cast.\nProtagonist Nick who may be a killer? RT staffers easily agreed that although Bradley Cooper may have to die his hair darker to truly become Nick, he’s already got Nick’s signature frat guy good looks. Plus he may be evil or he may be a grieving husband, but either way he will look darn good as the prime suspect.\nWe’d love to see Gillian Jacobs play the part of Amy. This Community star could easily transform herself into the rich, pampered daughter of two psychologists-turned-childrens’ book authors. We think that she could step into the awkward shoes of the real life inspiration for her parents fiction success with considerable aplomb — and walk the line between unknowable and supremely likable all at once. (Although that’s of course if Witherspoon doesn’t decide to step up to the role.)\nFinally, for the role of Nick’s beloved twin sister, Go — who happens to hate Amy with a passion — we’d call in Carey Mulligan. The actress lacks the Betty Boop, kewpie doll quality that Go (aka Margo) is described as having. However, Mulligan certainly calls to mind old screen star elegance. Furthermore, Go may be the only person readers like, so it’s important that she be played by someone we automatically gravitate toward.\nNow, we can’t cast anyone else without drastically spoilerizing, but we promise to let you know as soon as more news about this project is released. And for more film adaptation and TV updates, be sure to check out our monthly column From Page To Screen!\nquestion:Who has been signed on to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's \"Gone Girl\"?"]}

{"question_id": 173, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nMy daughter and her friends: Are they laughing at you?*\n*Nota bene\nToday, 5 months after starting the process, I got the call that JC, the main man of neurology at my hospital, signed my Tysabri order. Which, apparently, means that tomorrow the infusion center will call me to schedule the first infusion. I have to get it scheduled before August 31, or else go back and do another series of MRIs of the brain and spine. I'd definitely prefer not to, since the stuff they put into the IV (I can't remember the name of it) makes me go loco. Seriously. I have a weird reaction to it. Gadolinium, I think it is.\nI'm trying not to be whiney and complainy about my medical procedures. I don't do a very good job, though. My last MRI - a couple of months ago, turned out to be disturbing. They measure MS in terms of degrees of 'brain damage'. Basically, three categories - small, medium and large. Those aren't the actual words, but you get the drift. When I went to have the films reviewed, she said I was at the 'medium' level, which was new, and showed me a section on my corpus callosum which was also new. She showed me these lesions that looked like fingers - like a big, white, hand forming around that part of the brain. She said \"this is a classic set of MS lesions\", and that that particular area is where you'd see cognitive functionality being affected (one of my particular losses).\nLater, when I went in to work, I was telling some friends about the big, white hand and we started referring to it as the \"White People in My Brain\". I've got white people in my brain!!! \"Um, the white people in my brain are stopping me from understanding this Venn diagram...'\nAnother reason I dropped out of western medicine was because of things like this. Is it really helpful to know this? I really don't know. I wonder if, when it comes to damaging lesions in the brain, that ignorance might be bliss. I figure, you are going to experience whatever the damage is regardless of whether you saw it ahead of time.\nThe Tysabri news felt a bit bittersweet, because fellow MS'er Courtney had a bad reaction to her 2nd infusion yesterday, which was pretty heartbreaking for her. They say if you have an allergy, or sensitivity to it, it will most likely show on the 2nd one. Given the fear about PML, I've read they don't allow you to continue with the infusions after that. But that could be changing. There are been no new PML deaths since it went back on the market 14 months ago. Like me, Courtney seems to be a side effect magnet with the MS drugs. If we take it, they will come.\nSo, yesterday, I had the big mammo grammo. I don't know how long it has been since I had one. (My friend Paul said \"let's see, when did St. Elmo's Fire come out?\" Which just made me laugh like crazy.)\nI had my reasons. The last time I had one, they sent me in for surgery to have a tumor removed. Benign, as it turned out. It was a very unpleasant procedure that I felt I shouldn't have had to do to begin with. I should have had the balls to ask them to do a needle biopsy first, but at that time I wasn't aggressive enough to do that. I tend to get intimidated by the white coats and lose my sense of self. Now, when I have an important appointment that might require decisions, I bring my friend Scotti. Scotti is awesome - she survived metastasized malignant melanoma, and she's a great procedure buddy. She was by my side during my period of really awful miscarriages, one of which was an emergency room surgical thing with massive blood loss. But I dropped out of western medicine world for a while there because, I think, I was tired of the drama.\nI think it was about 14 years ago. So I was due. I'll pass on all the details of the mammo grammo (which Adam Sandler character says things like that? Opera man? Or the Louisiana guy? I started saying it because it made me laugh and thus feel less anxious.) Though I will say, the technician told me I looked like I was scared to death. Which I was. It was my first one since my 'enhancements' and I just could not imagine how this was going to happen.\nIt actually went remarkably well. Much less pain than the last time. It's funny - I have no reason to think that there are any other tumors or anything, but until they send me the \"prognosis negative\" letter, there's that period of waiting that tends to get on my nerves. Much like the Tysabri. I realized today, when I got the call, that I had had this undercurrent of \"waiting anxiety\" happening for several months.\nI am just not that good with the waiting thing. However, in the last year of diagnosing Adrian's dyslexia, finding the right school for him, living through Dagny's 7th grade, having my job change, and trying to get the Tysabri thing in place, I have done a lot of it. And here I am, with many of those things resolved or at least having 'resolution potential'. I have taken most of these things quite literally one step at a time. I would often not know what the next step would be until I finished the current step. It's been a good lesson in that tortoise-and-the-hare kind of stuff.\nNext up: 3rd grade, 8th grade, life on Tysabri? Here I come.\nI've gotta get some sleep - I think the white people are moving furniture around up there.\nquestion:What is the medical procedure the author is scheduled to undergo?"]}
{"question_id": 174, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nWhen thinking of the composition of his roster, Rangers coach Alain Vigneault reiterated throughout training camp that “money will be a factor.”\nIn the hard-salary-cap world of the NHL, is has to be, especially for a big-market team like the Rangers with big-money contracts already on the books. But now that the preseason schedule has concluded and the next game is the regular-season opener Thursday night at the Garden against the Islanders, the Rangers are hoping to obtain something they so rarely have had in the recent past: roster flexibility.\nThe current group of 24 players on the books does include forward Oscar Lindberg, still on injured reserve. It leaves the Rangers with just over $2 million in space under the $73 million salary-cap ceiling. The amount of money they are under the cap each day accrues, so a penny saved today is one that can be used tomorrow — or at the Feb. 28 trade deadline.\n“We’re definitely under the cap, but any more that we spend on a player not playing, we can use later on,” Vigneault said after Saturday’s practice at Chelsea Piers, having given his players off Sunday before returning Monday for three days of practice leading into the season opener.\n“I’m looking at the big picture,” Vigneault added. “That’s what I’m talking about.”\nThe Blueshirts have $47.825 million annually locked up in eight players — Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist. (And imagine if captain McDonagh wasn’t signed for such a club-friendly $4.7 million per season?) So eight players make up about 68 percent of the club’s salary, and the other 15 players make up the remaining 32 percent. The lopsided nature is true on almost all NHL teams, leaving an onus on young, relatively cheap players to contribute in big roles.\nSo as much as Vigneault’s ideal world contains a group with eight defensemen and 13 forwards, he knows it might not be the best scenario. If new defensemen Nick Holden and Adam Clendening are both scratched for the opener — which it seems they will be, barring a swing in opinion over the next few days of practice — they are still counting against the cap without playing. The decision then has to be made whether they’re worth keeping around to not play while losing future cap flexibility.\nClendening would have to clear waivers to be sent down to AHL Hartford, while waiving Holden would likely mean the Rangers would lose him for nothing. Yet if 22-year-old Brady Skjei struggles early on, it might not be a short leash or short patience that gets him sent down without waivers, but the cap implications.\nThe biggest difference from years past is the level of uncertainty that remains with what the Rangers have. They don’t know what to expect from Girardi coming off an awful season, preceded by so many good ones. Staal had a good camp, but is he back to being the aggressive and stout defenseman the team so desperately needs?\nThere is youth up front in Jimmy Vesey, Pavel Buchnevich and Mika Zibanejad, but how consistent can they be in carrying the offensive weight? Can Brandon Pirri keep scoring like he did in preseason, can Michael Grabner stay healthy and actually help the penalty kill, and can Josh Jooris be a steadying fourth-line center?\nThere are so many questions that can’t be answered yet, and it does very little good to try to guess what will happen. Instead, Vigneault and the front office are waiting with somewhat bated breath to see exactly what they have.\n“I’m thinking that we might, for a short amount of time, until we sort things out, see different players in NHL competition. We might keep 23,” Vigneault said. “But I’m not 100 percent sure yet.”\nHe’s not 100 percent sure because it’s unknown just what kind of team the Rangers are right now. And when they find out, they want the financial ability to be able to change on the fly.\nquestion:What is the total annual salary of the eight players Rick Nash, Derek Stepan, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello, Marc Staal, Dan Girardi, Ryan McDonagh and Henrik Lundqvist in the Rangers team?"]}

Ross Carlson found him and Dowell buried a one-timer over David Leggio’s right shoulder to make it 1-1 and give the Badgers a bit of momentum at 8:31.\nBut it took just 21 seconds for that momentum to swing back the other way, and it was Dodge again who came through with the answer that the Golden Knights were looking for.\nHe charged untouched toward the side of the net and collected the puck to the left of Elliott with a wide open left side. Elliott sprawled back, but was only able to get his stick down and Dodge lifted the puck up and over for his eighth goal of the year.\n“One of the things that we need to learn is coming back and not letting down,” UW senior Jeff Likens said. “We tie it up, we’ve got to keep going and keep playing.”\nLess than three minutes later, Clarkson doubled its lead.\nElliott blocked an initial shot from Tyrell Mason, but left the rebound out right to senior Michael Grenzy. The blue-liner wound up from the right circle and blasted one under the right arm of Elliott.\nIt was clear that those three minutes were the difference.\n“Any time you can come back and get a goal right after they score and take the crowd out of it and then come back and get another one I really thought that was the difference in the game,” Clarkson head coach George Roll said.\n“That span there is what, if you viewed the game, would be a turning point,” UW head coach Mike Eaves said. “I think that was the difference in the game when you look at the big picture.”\nThe Badgers’ woes continued and nearly seven minutes later, the Golden Knights essentially slammed the door with their third goal of the second period.\nMason and Shea Guthrie teamed up for their second assists in as many goals, this time on a four-on-four situation. This time they found Chris D’Alvise in the right circle and he beat Elliott with a shot into the far corner to make it 4-1 and the rout was on.\nAnd for as much as the goal-scoring was on, so was Leggio, who made a variety of stops to thwart any chance of a comeback.\n“I played poorly and their goalie played great,” Elliott said. “I think that was the difference in the game.”\nLeggio made 29 saves to gain his 11th victory of the season, while Elliott allowed six goals, tying a career-high in falling to 6-10-1.\nDodge completed his hat trick just three minutes into the final period. Grenzy scored his second of the game seven minutes later and UW freshman Andy Bohmbach scored his first collegiate goal to cap off the scoring.\nIt was clear that the time off over the holiday break coupled with the absence of three players at the World Junior Championships hurt the Badgers, but Eaves was disappointed nonetheless.\n“I factor that in, but the disappointing thing is why couldn’t we come back and play hard?” Eaves questioned.\nRoll also acknowledged that Wisconsin was not at full strength, but said he was not going to take anything away from his players, especially Dodge who put the team on his back to ensure that the Golden Knights came out hungry and rust-free.\nClarkson will take on Lake Superior State in the tournament’s championship game at 4:07 p.m. CT Saturday, while Wisconsin will face Providence in the consolation game.\nquestion:Who scored a hat trick in the hockey game between Clarkson and Wisconsin?"]}

{"question_id": 181, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nChanukah means “dedication” and celebrates the miracle of a day’s worth of oil used in the Temple lasting for eight days. The holiday commemorates the re-dedication of the (second) Temple in Jerusalem after it had been defiled under the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\nBACKGROUND: Judaism had been outlawed and in 167 BC Antiochus Epiphanes ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple and for pigs to be sacrificed. The sacrifice of pigs to the Greek gods was standard ritual practice in the Ancient Greek religion. Antiochus’s actions provoked a large-scale revolt.\nTHE MACCABEE BROTHERS: Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus Epiphanes. Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (“Judah the Hammer”). By 166 BC Mattathias had died and Judah took his place as leader.\nTHE VICTORY: By 165 BC the Maccabean revolt was successful, and the Temple was liberated and rededicated. After the forces of Antiochus had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the olive oil used to keep the 7-branch Menorah in the Temple lit had been profaned and couldn’t be used. They found a single vial that was still sealed by the High Priest with enough oil to keep the Menorah in the Temple lit for only one day but it took 8 days for new oil to be pressed from olives and made ready for use in the Menorah. The miracle that Chanukah commemorates is that one days worth of oil burned for eight days; enough time for the new oil to be pressed and made ready.\nHISTORICAL ACCOUNTS: The story of Chanukah is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) but are found in the Apocryphal books. The Jewish historian Josephus also writes about this in his renowned book, Antiquities of the Jews.\nChanukah is also mentioned in the New Testament in John 10;\n“At that time the Feast of Dedication [Chanuk\nHOW WE CELEBRATE: Jews celebrate by lighting an 8-branch candleabra with an additional candle each night for 8 nights. The middle candle, called the Shamash is the ‘helper’ candle that lights the others. We also eat foods fried in oil for each of the 8 nights and depending where Jews originate from, those foods differ. Ashkenazi Jews who are of Eastern European descent eat “latkes” which are are shallow-fried pancakes of grated potato, flour and egg and usually flavoured with grated onion. Latkes may be topped with a variety of condiments ranging from savory (e.g. sour cream) to sweet (e.g. apple saucer) or they may be served plain. Sephardic Jews who are of Middle Eastern descent eat various kinds of doughnuts and fritters, depending on the country of origin. In Israel, “sufganiyot” (סופגניות) are eaten, which are small round doughnuts filled with jelly or custard and topped with powered sugar. Like most Jewish celebrations, Chanukah is a time for family to gather and to share special food. It is also a time for games with a four sided top called a “dreydl” that has the four first letters of the expression “nes gadol haya sham” (נס גדול היה שם) which means ‘a great miracle happened there’\nNOT JEWISH CHRISTMAS: Chanukah is not one of the major holidays of the Jewish Calendar as are Passover, Rosh Hoshanah (New Year), Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles), Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) or Shevouth (Feast of Weeks / Pentecost). It is a minor festival but because it falls shortly before Christmas some families have elevated it to a significant occasion. While gifts are not traditionally given for Chanukah, parents usually give their children “Chanukah gelt” (Yiddish for ‘money’) and oftenthese gifts of money are associated with their children’s dedication to their studies. Chocolate coins in little sacks are also often given.\nREMEMBERING GOD: Like other Jewish holidays, Chanukah commemorates God acting on behalf of His people. The blessing that is said each night as the Chanukiah is lit (usually by the children) refers to God having ‘wrought miracles for our fathers in days of old’. As we celebrate this season, be it Chanukah or Christmas and for some, both may we remember God and all He has done for us. And may we be a people marked by thankfullness.\n! חג אורים שמח\nHappy Festival of Lights !\nquestion:What does Chanukah celebrate and how is it traditionally celebrated?"]}

The motion to approve was made by Helen Hall, seconded by Nilo Niccolai and unanimously approved by the members present.\nAll Working Group members are invited and encouraged to be present at the City Council meeting at 4:00 p.m. on March 16, 2004, when the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton is presented to the Council for funding.\nCharles Kalil, Information Manager, City of Garden, described the evolution and implementation of that city's wireless network. Charles' predecessor initiated the installation of a wireless system in 1999 for the purpose of connecting six police substations. Worldwide Wireless, now known as Global Pacific, connected the six sites at a cost of $60,000. The project was eventually canceled. Garden Grove then investigated the possibility of connecting public safety facilities with DSL telephony, but found that the city would have to pay commercial rates. The cost to the police for operating Motorola radios was $65,000 per year. Consequently, a search began for a less expensive solution.\n5G Wireless, Marina del Rey, proposed a point-point system utilizing 802.11b technology with data rates of 3.0-3.5 Mbps. An antenna was placed on city hall with reception at all substations. The cost of the system was $9,000 for the main antenna and $1,500 for each substation. All police substations (9) and fire stations (7) are now linked wirelessly. The network runs on Linux with 128-bit encryption. Interference has been a problem at only one fire station and the maintenance yard has experienced some dropout. The signal passes through or around some trees and buildings. Most sites are elevated relative to their surroundings.\nEnterprise System Consulting recommended that Alvarion equip the 802.11b system with frequency hopping. With this system it is possible to connect vehicles such as police cars that are moving at speeds up to 60 mph. It is anticipated that it will take 32-40 access points to cover the city with wireless connectivity. The total cost to build out the city is estimated to be $300,000 including the installation of wireless units in vehicles. The cost to equip each police car including installation is about $5,000. Police equipped with PDAs will be able to connect wirelessly to the system and back to headquarters through the units in the police cars.\nBell Gardens and Laguna Beach have similar wireless networks. Westminster has some hot spots. Grant money is available for the construction of wireless infrastructure for public safety.\nHelen Hall and Paul Stover graciously agreed to be responsible for preparing a PowerPoint presentation in support of the proposal to create a wireless mesh network in downtown Fullerton. Paul and Helen will also make the presentation to the Council. The goal is to obtain redevelopment funds in the amount of $56,000 in order to conduct this pilot project. A wireless system for the Fullerton library is included in the request.\nPossible presentation by Verilan or Cingular\nNext steps regarding wireless implementation for downtown Fullerton\nReview of action items\nStuart Davis, Stellans Technologies, a wireless networking company based in Fullerton and a colleague of Working Group member Johnson Lew, offered to donate equipment and labor to create a wireless network in the Fullerton library. Stellans recently completed installing a wireless network in the Anaheim Hilton. Stuart and Johnson said that in a few hours Stellans could set up the wireless network using excess equipment that it already has on hand. The Working Group expressed its appreciation and referred Stuart to Helen Hall and Al Milo, Library Director, for further discussion of the offer.\nThere being no further business, Chair Burtner asked for a motion to adjourn the meeting. The motion to adjourn was made by David Bailey, seconded by Paul Stover and unanimously approved by the members present. The meeting adjourned at 10:25am.\nquestion:What was the purpose of the wireless system initiated in Garden Grove in 1999?"]}

FFC Frankfurt captain Nadine Angerer injured, experienced midfielder Sandra Smisek will wear the armband in next Thursday's UEFA Women's Champions League final against Olympique Lyonnais. The 34-year-old former Germany international speaks about her excitement at the Olympiastadion showdown and explains why she does not mind being called \"Grandma\".\nUEFA.com: Frankfurt are in a big European final for the first time in a few years. You must be delighted.\nSandra Smisek: Of course. We haven't been playing in Europe for a while. Every athlete loves to compete with the best, and in the club game that means the Champions League. That is why we are very happy to have made it to the final.\nUEFA.com: You personally won the old UEFA Women's Cup twice. Is the competition even more special now it has changed its name?\nSmisek: The name itself sounds better as the UEFA Champions League final. Also it's played over one game, whereas it used to be played over two legs. I think it's better to play once.\nUEFA.com: What will be the key to beating Lyon?\nSmisek: That's a good question. Lyon are a very good team with top quality players. We're happy that it will be Lyon because we already know 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam from the league. It will be an interesting game, 50-50 I think. Form on the day will decide it, and character – the will to bring the title back home. I will give my all for it to be Frankfurt.\nUEFA.com: Is it an advantage to be playing the final in Germany?\nSmisek: Not necessarily. Of course it is nice for us to have a kind of home game. But I don't think Frankfurt would prepare differently if we were playing somewhere else. Maybe there are details that will give us a little advantage, but they will not be decisive ones.\nUEFA.com: Would victory represent a career highlight?\nSmisek: Absolutely. It's a long time since we've been here. I don't get so many chances to win trophies these days, and that's why I'm looking forward to it. I stopped playing for the national team in 2008, so I only have my club left. That's why it has a big importance for me personally.\nUEFA.com: Frankfurt's European campaign has been a rollercoaster ride, with away defeats in the first three rounds...\nSmisek: From the beginning we faced strong opponents with great skill and it was difficult away from home. But I think it's an advantage to play tough games on the way to a final and to knock out some strong opponents. Lyon will be our toughest opponent yet, but I think we deserve to be in the Champions League final.\nUEFA.com: How does it feel to be wearing the armband in Nadine Angerer's absence?\nSmisek: It would be better if Nadine wasn't injured and I didn't have to wear this thing on the pitch. But I am vice-captain so it's normal. I don't mind doing it, someone needs to take over the responsibility. I have been given it and I think I'm doing it quite well.\nUEFA.com: Desirée Schumann will come in to replace Angerer in goal. It's a big test for her, but she's looked assured so far.\nSmisek: Absolutely. She was already impressing a lot in training before Nadine got injured. Whenever she has played she has been very focused. She has a great personality. Schumann has shown us we can trust her despite her young age.\nUEFA.com You have a very young coach too in Sven Kahlert. What is he like?\nSmisek: He's very meticulous and passionate about his role. His coaching team of four are doing a good job and they give us a lot of good and tough sessions. They are putting us on the right track.\nUEFA.com: Frankfurt general manager Siggi Dietrich dubbed you the 'Grande Dame' not long ago. Is that flattering or would you rather not be seen as the old head?\nSmisek: I very often get called 'Grandma'. I know it's meant in a nice way and sometimes I get other compliments. I'm the oldest in the squad and I perform well at this level. So if they want to call me that, they can.\nquestion:Who will wear the armband for 1.

But unfortunately, for some people, there can also be the a-a-choo that seems to come with the season.\nSneezing, sinus congestion, fatigue — it could just be the common cold, but researchers recently pointed to a surprising possible cause for the uptick in allergy like symptoms that is seen over the holidays. And aghast, the culprit may be one of the most beloved symbols of the season: the Christmas tree.\nIn the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, researchers from the State University of New York noted that \"respiratory illnesses peak around Christmas.\"\n\"Within two weeks of putting a tree up, you can experience symptoms due to either the smell of pine resin in 'live' trees or various molds found in the trees,\" wrote American Family Care (AFC), a national health care system of urgent and family care facilities.\nIn the past, physicians and researchers had thought that the rise in cold-like symptoms over the holidays were \"sparked by tree pollen and weed killer applied to trees,\" according to AFC.\nIn 2011, the State University researchers noted that the trigger was more likely the, \"molds found in live Christmas trees.\" In fact, 70 percent of the molds on the trees were suspect.\nThe American Christmas Tree Association (ACTA) notes that because most trees for purchase, \"are harvested well in advance of Christmas and stored in moist holding areas prior to settling in your home, undesirable mold spores have time to develop and grow. When you bring one of these live trees inside, these same microscopic spores that usually float freely outdoors, float freely in the enclosed sanctuary of your home. Floating molds create an atmosphere that can make someone with allergies quite susceptible to asthma and increasing sinus issues,\" wrote ACTA.\nBut before you decide to haul your tree to the recycling center, AFC and ACTA offer several things you can do to lessen the chances of what is referred to as Christmas Tree Syndrome.\nBoth organizations recommend washing off the tree and letting it dry before bringing it into the home. That idea might not always be feasible in changing Colorado where temperature could turn your efforts into natural icicles on the branches. But on warmer days, this is a positive option for removing mold spores from the tree.\nWearing gloves and a long-sleeved shirt as you bring the tree inside can also help. This can keep you from touching sap, which contains terpene and other substances that can irritate skin and mucous membranes, noted ACTA.\nDr. Johnny Shen, a board-certified physician with American Family Care's Doctors Express, an urgent and family care center in Cherry Creek, notes that they do see an increase in the number of patients coming in with allergy type symptoms during the Christmas season.\n\"But we don't immediately chock it up to Christmas Tree Syndrome. For the most part it wouldn't be the first thing we think of,\" said Shen. He pointed to the importance of getting a good history before determining the cause. \"There's a list of questions we might ask. 'Have you been exposed to mold dust? Have you been up in the mountains? If you get closer to the tree does your wheezing or other symptoms increase?\"\nShen cautions against self-diagnosing. \"Go see a doctor if you have shortness of breath. If you have a fever, make sure it's not an infection — you may have a bacterial infection that needs to be treated.\"\nIf it is determined that you most likely do have an allergic reaction to Christmas trees, there are some things you can do that may help. To avoid molds, avoid trees that have been cut and stored for some time. A freshly cut tree may work better for you. If you are allergic to pine oil or pine pollen (conifer pollen), then the freshly cut ones may cause you more problems.\n\"If you have allergies, maintain good air flow by using an air purifier,\" suggested Shen. \"We'd recommend not keeping your tree longer than four to seven days in the house.\"\nBefore you rush out and decide to purchase an artificial tree, be aware that they can also induce allergic reactions, usually from dust. Remember to cover your artificial tree and store it to avoid excessive dust. When you pull it out for the new season, take a moment to wipe it down.\nFor those who are prone to allergies, taking a few precautions can help them enjoy the beauty of their Christmas tree and avoid the discomfort of Christmas Tree Syndrome.\nquestion:What is a possible cause for the increase in allergy-like symptoms during the holiday season?"]}

Our work is based on the field of neuroscience, mindfulness and positive psychology. We help individuals and organizations achieve top performance.\nThe Work Mindfulness Project focuses on the science of mindfulness-based awareness, as a way to realign individuals and teams towards greater performance, to improve and enhance day-to-day experiences. In 2014, Dr. Joseph Loizzo, Dr. Miles Neal and Sharon Salzberg attended the first event at NYU in Manhattan. Our focus has always been small groups, individuals, and communities, to enhance awareness, through the relationships to self, others, community, values, ideals, and ongoing, moment-to-moment practice. Our programs are scientifically proven to relieve stress, increase awareness, and help individuals generate a higher level of performance, with tools to strengthen stress resilience, engage the brain, and enhance choice.\nHow does mindful awareness work in our daily lives? What is it that happens when we are mindfully aware? We work with clients throughout several areas of life. In the diagram below we outline what key areas help to make up a balanced life. These offer perspective and are by no way limited to the work that we might do together.\nOur approach incorporates the Health & Wellbeing model outlined in the image to the right. We look at you, your values, and what really matters to you, to help you develop Mindful Awareness. Being fully aware, you are paying attention in-the-moment so that you can make conscious, proactive choices about every aspect of your health.\nThe series of eight concentric circles represent your self-care, which includes all the choices you make on a daily basis that affect your physical, mental, and spiritual health. Our coaching and counseling services are one part of a professional care program that we recommend you receive as a part of the prevention and treatment of illnesses or diseases, including both traditional and complementary medicine, such as acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, and other mind-body therapies. The outer ring represents the people and groups to whom you are connected, reflecting your community.\nWhy work with Work Mindfulness?\nBecause Your Life Matters to YOU\nWe coach you and can help you identify blind spots and opportunities to overcome obstacles and focus on what’s important.

There is always a chance to win, even if things go sideways. You can download Nickeloden all-star brawl on your PC, ps4, ps5, or Xbox.\nGraphics\nDevelopers focused mostly on the idea of the game, so graphics are quite usual for 2D animation. They are vibrant and dynamic but lack details. Characters are drawn in the same style, so even if they are from different cartoons, they will look quite similar. However, the colors are bright and pleasant. The movements change really quickly what makes the whole process fun and enjoyable.\nReplayability\nNickelodeon all-star brawl has various characters, and you may play it for hours. It’s great for several minutes breaks and kids will like it too. However, it doesn’t have any level progression, and locations are generic, which lowers the replayability rating. This is a type of game which you can play for a long time, forget about it abruptly, and return to it several months later. It has an avarage replayability level among other free games of this genre.\nGameplay\nAs written above, this game is based on combats between diverse Nickelodeon characters. It has various locations where you can play face to face or together with many players. There are no levels. You may get some items as gifts but they don’t play a big role in your fighting development. Playing Nickeloden all-star brawl is not very convenient on Xbox. You should use diverse buttons combinations, which is easier to do with a joystick. So, Nickelodeon all-star brawl for Xbox is a better choice. It’s quite easy to control characters, and they move extremely fast for a 2D game like this.\nSome players note that even though the game was created with Nickeloden in mind, the atmosphere there is not like cartoons have. There is a lack of music and some characters look a little differently than in movies. But some fans are all steamed up about the game. Overall, you may install Nickelodeon all-star brawl because it’s very funny and allows you to try various characters in combats.\nConclusion\nThe game is nice and perfect for those who like Nickelodeon cartoons. Even if you have never watched any of them, you can enjoy this game because of the high-level motion gameplay and variety of characters. This is not the game where you can develop your character and gain some levels. Here you can just download Nickelodeon all-star brawl relax and get fun.\nPros:\n- Dynamic and vibrant\n- A lot of characters\n- Has many locations.\nCons:\n- No level progression\n- Low-level graphics.\nHow much storage do you need?\n\nquestion:What are the pros and cons of the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl game?"]}

According to a tweet by WalkingCat, the Windows 10 build 16212 which Microsoft accidentally released a few days ago, doesn’t include the backup feature.\nSpecifically, the Twitter user notices that making new backups with File History is no longer supported. This could mean that Microsoft might be ready to completely remove the feature with the upcoming Fall Creators Update.\nAs mentioned above, the File History Backup Tool has been around since Windows 8. Microsoft introduced the feature with the famous OS back in 2012.

However, it seems like the company has something else in mind for backup once the Fall Creators Update drops.\nNew backup option and alternatives\nWithout a doubt, Microsoft will provide a backup option for Windows 10. Until the company confirms the removal of File History, users can still benefit from it.\nAs for the future, those in doubt can also create backups in Windows 10 using third-party software.

{"question_id": 190, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nSince mid-February (and so much has happened that I haven't had a chance to write about it - but that's another story involving the Collective!) Deor of Widsith & Deor has begun a second radio show on Phonic, a Thursday morning weekly slot - ambitious given the time constraints? Certainly, but he's managing very well, and I have been recruited as the Associate Script Editor, reading the scripts that come in and assessing them for broadcast. It's been another rollercoaster, as squeezing it all in with everything else is just madness, but to my surprise (although there are scripts waiting to be read even as I write) it is proving possible.\nThe Show alternates between dramatic storytelling by Deor, storyteller/solo renditions of classic plays, so far Greek tragedy! and plays sent in by playwrights, so far ones with access to their own recording studios and actors, which is brilliant. We have been amazed and delighted at the quality of the work sent in, and as the Phonic Drama Show swings between experimental and Exeter's answer to Radio 4, so the fortnightly 'Widsith and Deor Presents...' has been making occasional stabs at being the city's reply to Radio 3...no comments on how it's been going, we have no producer but ourselves!\nThe solo Greek tragedies, Euripedes' 'The Bacchae' and his (almost unwatchable and unlistenable in the grim stakes as well as so loaded that it was banned by the Greek colonels in the 1960's) 'Trojan Women' have both been performed by Deor. I have to admit I wasn't sure it could be done, as both have quite a number of characters! But was astounded, as ever by his versatility. 'The Bacchae' is one of the most beautiful plays ever written, with incredibly poetic language, and one of those tragedies that is, for me, like Macbeth - there are times when you want to cry, but, like the opera Carmen, somehow everything is as it should be, and the gods or the witches or the cards have their way, and strangely it seems right in that context. The Trojan Women by contrast is one of the grimmest and possibly finest, and certainly earliest known, of anti-war plays ever written. It deals with war from the what-happen-to-the-civilians? view - the women after the city is captured. Enough said.\nIn the storytelling shows, Deor has been doing epic cycles from the Finnish Kalevala, and this morning's show was of Viking myths of the gods, but told as a series, with background techno/dance tracks to up the tempo and tension. It was powerful stuff - well, I was moved, and I've heard some of them many times before. The interpretation took up the usual mantle of blood-thirsty gore and comic book slapstick of the Norse gods' tales and turned them into a well-forged blade, dipped in ironies and laden with extra depths, multi-faceted, bringing out the real tragedy and the dark politics involved in a way that I've seldom heard done with Nordic retellings. A heady brew!\nOnce a month at the moment there's a 'Storyclub Special' where whatever we've managed to record from that month's Storyclub gets played on the show. I say 'managed' as Michael Dacre must've put a copyright spell on his tales, as the machine never plays back his brilliant tellings!\nMore new plays are in the pipeline, including a political satire by the author of our first featured play the tragi-comedic 'The Rose Garden', Simon Jackson a professional writer and film maker based in Edinburgh.

There is no middle ground.\"\nWith those sharp-tongued season one words, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) set the tone for all the ensuing political maneuvering and murdering on Game of Thrones. But now that she's sitting on the throne, it appears there's some miserable middle ground after all.\nThroughout her time on Thrones, the House Lannister lioness has clawed and roared at all enemies in her path, decimating any visible threat posed against her family. But despite all attempts at keeping her children safe, Cersei watched as all three died, one after another: Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), poisoned at his own royal wedding; Myrcella (Nell Tiger Free), poisoned in Dorne; and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman), poisoned by the words and actions of too many bad advisors — his own mother included.\nIn the wake of Cersei's wildfire assault on the Sept of Baelor, and in the wake of Tommen's subsequent suicide, Cersei now sits upon the throne she so desperately tried to protect for her children through all of these years — now completely childless, with very few friends and very many enemies. Yes, she won the game of thrones, but only for now, and only after the most precious people in her life died. And given the odds stacked against her, it's only a matter of time before she loses the great game for good.\nThere are thousands of different directions left for Game of Thrones as the HBO series enters its endgame, but for Cersei, there's only one outcome: defeat. It's only a matter of how she'll lose, and that's where the options become many.\nThe most obvious threat is the arrival of a new queen: Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), sailing from Meereen toward Westeros at long last, bringing a bountiful army, critical alliances and three fire-breathing dragons with her. But perhaps Dany's greatest asset in a war against House Lannister is Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), the most reviled figure in Cersei's world. If season seven doesn't feature a final showdown between the Lannister siblings, then there truly is no justice.\nA secondary threat is a second Lannister brother: Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Cersei's twin, lover, and the father of her deceased children. Two episodes before the finale, Jaime doubled down on his unending love for Cersei. But the look the twins exchanged in their final moments of the season spoke volumes: Jaime, a man who killed a king to save thousands of lives, was forced to confront the reality that the most important person in his life just followed in the Mad King's footsteps. In the face of further fire, the Kingslayer could become the Queenslayer.\nIn both the cases of Dany and Jaime, their roles in Cersei's eventual takedown would fulfill the conditions of Maggy the Frog's prophecy. The old witch told Cersei she would outlive her own children, that she would rule until a \"younger and more beautiful\" queen casts her down, and that she would ultimately die at the hands of the \"valonqar,\" High Valyrian for \"little brother.\" Jaime is Cersei's younger sibling by seconds.\nBeyond those external threats, there are internal foes, including Cersei's inner circle. She's flanked by only two trusted allies at this point: Maester Qyburn (Anton Lesser) and Gregor Clegane (Hafthor Bjornsson), two decidedly deadly individuals for very different reasons. Do they have Cersei's best interests at heart, ultimately? Qyburn's motives remain an unsettling mystery, while the Mountain does little more than follow Cersei's precise orders — a directive that typically ends in gruesome gore.\nWith that in mind, however, the truth becomes clear: when it comes to Cersei's downfall, all roads lead right back to Cersei and her call for violence. Her destructive actions have brought her to this point, and are bound to bury her in the end, whether it's because she instigates someone into action, or because she enacts a plan that backfires in literally explosive fashion.\n\"I choose violence,\" Cersei said earlier in season six, three words that echo throughout the character's arc — and words that will undoubtedly be with her when her time on Thrones inevitably ends.\nWatch the video for more on the season finale's highlights:\nFollow THR's Game of Thrones coverage for more deep dives, interviews and news.\nJosh WiglerTHRnews@thr.com @thr\nquestion:Who are the two trusted allies of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones?"]}

{"question_id": 196, "category": "rag", "turns": ["context:\nIf an Englishman’s home is his castle, his family home is undoubtedly his Buckingham Palace. They’re unimaginably precious to us, holding our memories and identities, biro-drawn height charts, and idiosyncrasies that estate agents can’t begin to appreciate the value of. This, of course, makes the prospect of selling all the harder. So what do you need to consider when selling? We’d start by doing the following…\n1. Detach and de-sentimentalise. First, and foremost, practise a bit of emotional detachment: consider it the ultimate in decluttering. By letting go of material possessions (in this case, almost all of them at once and the brickwork, oak floors and Farrow and Ball paint too), you can free yourself for new adventures and space for new memories. It’s hard to walk around the rooms our children grew up in and see them as little more than selling points, but removing the romanticism will help you to start a new chapter.\n2. Persuade your family members to do the same. You might be surprised (or not, depending on how vocal your offspring usually are) to find that grown up children are the most resistant to selling the family home… the very walls hold a great deal of power over kids who have flown the nest, even if they now have children themselves. Throughout tumultuous break ups, career moves and milestones, the building and its contents (and you within it) has been their one constant point of reference. Give everyone plenty of time to come around to the idea, and warn them when professional photos and for sale signs are going up: it will come as less of a shock.\n3. Decide how you’re going to sell it, and to whom. How are you going to make a sale? Will you enlist the services of We Buy Any House, or offer it to the highest bidder at an auction? Would you feel most comfortable using an estate agent, or would you prefer to make a sale via a private agreement? Decide on the hows and whos of selling, as this will help to make handing over the deeds feel like the right decision.\n4. Have an interim plan. Doubtless you’re on the precipice of change: be it travelling, downsizing or renting. Make sure you have somewhere to go and a way of funding your lifestyle until you’re settled into your new normal. Sales can take a while and things can get expensive if events don’t unfold as you’re expecting, so have a back up plan and a place to stay.\n5. Be clear about what you want for the future. It’s no good selling if it feels like a poor exchange, so before you put it on the market, be very clear about what you want your next place to look like. Where will it be? How big is it? What input does it require from you to make it feel like it’s yours? Who will visit? How will it fit into your life going forward? Write a list of answers responding to questions like these. If you feel happy about where you end up next, you’ll feel more at peace about selling your family home to someone else.\nDisclosure: This post was brought to you in collaboration with We Buy Any Home. Thank you for supporting the brands that help make JuggleMum possible.\nMy 10-year-old daughter has already told us that she’s never leaving home and if we want to move when she’s older, she’s buying this house.\nGood to know we’ve got a buyer in the future!!\nMy kids have said similar too but I think they’d want us to give it to them…. No chance!!\nSome good tips. My adcice would be don’t sell to some mad woman who wants to sign on lucky days – there wasn’t one for weeks.\nWhat a ‘mare! I wonder what made the date lucky?!\nIn a way I am glad we are in a rental property but I would like to own a property in the future.

We’re now renovating to make the house nice – I really don’t like it here, but hope that a re-do will spark some kind of love for it.\nOoh yeah, I definitely found it odd when my parents sold the house I grew up in – it meant their next house was ‘my parents house’ rather than home – it was a long time ago, but at the time I found it really sad!\nI love moving house but my husband says we have to stay where we are for a good few years after four house moves in about 8 years x\nGreat tips! I hope I never have to move house again! It was the most stressful thing I have ever done.\nIt was for me too but it was 15 years ago now so the memory has faded somewhat!\nThanks for the tips – I’ve never sold a house before but I think I would be a little more confident on where to start now!\nquestion:What are some of the considerations to keep in mind when selling a family home?"]}

Metzger placed fifth at the state tournament. Metzger finished his career 85-51.\n“Connor’s hard work and dedication made him a good leader,” said Ostby. “He was expected to win. No matter if he was wrestling a No. 1 ranked wrestler or not.”\nHarrison wrapped up his senior season 28-7, just missing a state trip by dropping a true-second match to take third in the section. He wrapped up his career in orange and black with a 70-53 record.\n“He was the hardest worker on the team by far,” said Ostby. “Connor will admit that because of Joel, he went to state.\n“We’re going to miss these boys,” added Ostby. “They were like big brothers to the young kids.”\nSeveral young kids are coming up to help fill the spots left open by the seniors, including 17 wrestlers with at least some varsity experience.\nJunior Dillan Johnson, the other Tiger state entrant, took first place in Section 3AA and finished the season 29-13.\n“Dillan had his best wrestling at the end of the year,” said Ostby. “His technique improved and he was finding ways to win the close matches.”\nMyles Smith finished the season 17-15 and took fourth at sections.\n“If he stays healthy, Myles will be in contention to go to state,” said Ostby. “He’s got all the tools.”\nTravis Ostby finished his freshman year 25-18, placing third at sections after losing a true-second match.\n“He’ll be a key in our middle weights,” said Ostby. “He can wrestle up a weight or two to help us match up well in duals.”\nAlec Gausman finished his sophomore year 9-24.\n“He’s going to be our big guy next year,” explained Ostby. “He’ll need to step up and be the anchor for us.”\nThe highlight of the season for coach Ostby was finishing 12th of 35 teams at the Big Bear Tournament in December. The Tigers had five place winners at the invite. Ostby describes the invite as a “mini state tournament.”\nAt the Belgrade-Brooten-Elrosa tournament, the Tigers placed fifth and had another five place winners. The Tigers took fourth at the Grant County Tournament, earning 10 individual place winners. At the Big Ole Tournament in Alexandria, the Tigers finished sixth and had seven wrestlers place. The Tigers were fourth at the West Central Conference Tournament, where eight Tigers placed. Travis Ostby, Evan Nelson, Connor Metzger, and Joel Harrison earned all-conference status at the meet. Dillan Johnson received an honorable mention.\nThe regular season wrapped up with the Tigers’ home invite at which 11 wrestlers from the home team placed.\n“That was pretty impressive,” said Ostby. “It was awesome. With the talent we have we were right where we should have been. We peaked at the right time.”\nOstby is looking forward to next season and is excited about the Tigers’ opportunities. Two teams, Adrian and Montevideo, will no longer be part of Section 3AA. Joining the Tigers’ section will be New Ulm. Adrian was the section champion this season and also took seven individuals to the state tournament.\n“That makes our chances even better in 2014,” explained Ostby. “That’s seven more spots for our kids to get to state.”\nMaking it to the state tournament will require wrestlers to get in a lot of wrestling in the off-season and attend a couple of camps. Mick Rose is running a freestyle Greco league for K-12 wrestlers this summer.\nThe Tigers experienced success in the classroom, as well as on the mat, earning the Silver Award for Academics with a GPA of 3.43.\n“The kids understand what it takes,” added Ostby. “Our goal is to win championships. We won’t be satisfied until we do.”\nquestion:Who were the four senior wrestlers that graduated from the Tiger team in the 2012-2013 season?"]}

In addition to the Argentinean release also in perfect time for this summertime heat, the second feature of the release showcases some exceeding good whites from the Loire Valley. One in particular is really dynamite and it sells for under twenty bucks. Read the rest of this entry » »\nViticulture Students’ Strip Down\nI truly have a great job. I get to teach what I love to do. My campus, in the heart of Niagara’s wine country, primarily delivers cooking, horticultural and viticulture programs. Hell, we are even starting up a Brewmeister program in the fall. One of my former students from Fanshawe College, Ben Andrew, who graduated Culinary Management program moved down to Niagara and enrolled in the wine making program.\nBen introduced me to some of his classmates and I have, on several occasions, tasted a wine or two with them. Now I figured it was my time to pull a few corks and play the role of host.

That was our calendar in late April through early May, and we couldn’t have asked for a finer return to California wine country for the first time since 2002. We decided right from the get-go that we were going to do it right this time; no exhaustive three of more appointments per day, and not even one appointment every day. We were going to enjoy ourselves, take our time, see some of the state and concentrate on a select group of producers, two of whom were new to our experience and three with whom we were very familiar.\nOur travels took us to Napa Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Mendocino County, Paso Robles and the Santa Cruz Mountains. On off days, we simply toured or renewed acquaintances with old friends like Allan Bree, Frank Joyce and John and Pat Wolf. And of course, there was never any lack of good food and wine, as we’ve already detailed with recent blog entries.\nOur site visits were all marvelous, and included appointments with John Olney at Ridge Lytton Springs, Julie Johnson at Tres Sabores, Mario and Danelle Storm Rosati at Rosati Family Winery, Jason Haas at Tablas Creek Vineyard, Paul Draper at Ridge Monte Bello and Sean Thackrey at his barn… OK, it’s REALLY Sean’s office-auxiliary storage facility outside of Bolinas and equipped with a kitchen many would envy.\nWe made extensive use of the video camera, and indeed, some of our reports could have stood on that footage alone – candid as they are, but there are always anecdotes and tasting notes to be included.\nOur trip report begins in reverse, with accounts of our last two visits, with Paul Draper and Sean Thackrey. We met with the two of them just a few days apart, and couldn’t help but be struck by the differences in style and technique of these two otherwise brilliant winemakers. Subsequent reports will follow individually in quick succession.

I don’t mean that in a smarmy thumb-your-nose-at-Napa-because-the-French-make-better-rosé-than-the-locals-do kind o’ way, because that’s not necessarily true. It’s just that there’s something amusingly ironic about going to the heart of California wine country, only to drink French wine as the weather warms and the growing season starts to get into full swing. It also bears pointing out that these three cost less than anything made locally that we happened to run into, not that we searched every nook and cranny in a quest to price comparatively. These three are simply the ones that looked the best to us in our travels, so they’re the ones we bought, and as it turns out, all were quite satisfying, starting with a producer that’s new to us.

Allan brought along two equally delightful wines from one of our very favorite producers, Domaine Tempier in Bandol, which we proceeded to enjoy with a succession of delicious appetizers and entrees, including Chef Jeanty’s famous cream of tomato soup, deep fried Great Lakes smelt, a marvelous artichoke heart terrine with lemon pesto, Epaule De Porc (slow roasted pork shoulder), steak tartare and a lovely little duck tart.

We have much more experience with these, so in a way, it was like welcoming an old friend back in our glasses, even if we hadn’t had this particular vintage. We’ve never had a Dehlinger that we didn’t like, and this was certainly not the one to ruin that track record. Read the rest of this entry »\nHospice du Rhone 2010 Friday Seminars – S. African Syrahs and Cote Rotie\nBoth Friday seminars are presented in this post:\n“We’ve Come a Long Way Baby!\nThe Past, Present and Future of South African Syrah”\nOne of the best things about Hospice du Rhone is the world-wide focus of the event. Sure, domestic wines are front and center, especially from the Central Coast, but HdR has always celebrated the WORLD of Rhone varietals, both here, their home in France, and in all of the wine-producing countries in the world. So it was appropriate that HdR 2010’s seminar lineup kicked off with an in-depth look at South Africa, one of the oldest wine-growing regions, and yet one of the newest, too, particularly as a producer of high quality Rhone varietals and blends.
